educated at <i>Paris</i>, <i>Lorrain</i>, <i>Venice</i>,
<i>Bologna</i>, and <i>Padua</i>; made
great Progress in his Studies,
having acquir’d a Knowledge in
near Ten different Languages;
was sometime in <i>London</i>, with the Emperor
<i>Ferdinand</i>’s Ambassador; returned to <i>Flanders</i>,
and from thence to <i>Vienna</i>, where he was appointed
Ambassador to <i>Solyman the Great</i>, and
soon set out for <i>Constantinople</i>; but not finding
him there, was obliged to go to <i>Amasia</i>, &amp;c.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_iv"></a>[iv]</span>
and during his long Stay in that Country,
having a strong Propensity to Learning, collected
many valuable Manuscripts, Coins,
<i>&amp;c.</i> Took great Delight in procuring rare
Plants, and studying the Nature of Animals;
made himself perfect Master of the <i>Turkish</i>
State, Policy, <i>&amp;c.</i> That the Account he
composed of his Journey, is a very good
Work, and deserves the Approbation of all
good Judges; the Learned <i>Sadelerius</i>, in his
Edition of it, Printed at <i>Mons</i>, asserts it deserves
a Thousand Impressions. The Celebrated
<i>Thuanus</i> owns he transcribed many
Things out of it to insert in his History, and
likewise gives a great Character of the Author
and his Work. In short, as we have no
good Account of that Country and People,
an <i>English</i> Version, ’tis presum’d, will be agreeable
to the Public.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">As</span> I promised you, at parting, to give
you a full Account of my Journey
to <i>Constantinople</i>, so, I shall now
make good my Word; and I hope,
with Advantage too. For, I shall
also acquaint you with my Adventures
in my Travel to <i>Amasia</i>, as well as That to
<i>Constantinople</i>, the <i>former</i> being less used, and consequently
far less known, than the <i>latter</i>. My Design
herein, is, to allow you a Part of the Solace,
of what happened pleasurable to me; for so the
ancient Friendship betwixt us obliges me, to appropriate
no Joy to myself, without communicating the
same to you; but, as for what happened incommodious
to me, (as, in so long and tedious a Journey,
some Things must needs do) those I take to my
self; neither would I have you concerned in them
at all; for, the Danger being now past, the more
grievous they were to suffer, the more pleasant will
they be, even to myself, to remember and commit
to Writing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the Receipt of his Letter, <i>Ferdinand</i> was
at a stand; he did not fully believe, nor yet altogether
disbelieve him; he was inclined to suspect,
that the Memory of his <i>former</i> Sufferings, and the
Fear of <i>future ones</i>, did deter him from that Employment,
rather than the Danger of his Disease;
and yet, on the other side, he did not think it
creditable for himself to employ a Man that had
so well deserved of him and of the Commonwealth,
in any Service against his Will. But the
Death of <i>Malvezius</i>, which followed a few Months
after, did sufficiently convince him, that his Disease
was not pretended, to decline the Employment,
but was really a Mortal one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> this, I was substituted in the Place of
<i>Malvezius</i>: But, being unexperienced (as I said before)
in the Affairs and Manners of the <i>Turks</i>,
King <i>Ferdinand</i> thought it adviseable for me to
bestow a Visit upon <i>Malvezius</i> in his Sickness, that
so, by his Directions and Advice, I might be better
cautioned and armed against any Impositions of the
captious <i>Turks</i>. Two Days I staid with him,
which was as much as the straitness of my Time
would permit; and I husbanded them so well, as
to be informed by him, what I was to act, and
what to avoid, in my daily Convention with the
<i>Turks</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereupon</span>, I posted back to <i>Vienna</i>, and
began, with great Application and Diligence, to
prepare Necessaries for my Journey. But such was
the Flush of Business, and so little the Time allowed
to dispatch it, that, when the Day fixt for my
Departure came, though the King did earnestly
press me forward, and I had been extremely Busy
all the Day in equipping myself, and in causing
Bag and Baggage to be pack’d up, even from the
fourth Watch; yet it was the first Watch of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
following Night, before I could be quite ready;
but then the Gates of <i>Vienna</i>, which at that time
of Night us’d always to be shut, were opened on
purpose for me. The Emperor went abroad a
Hunting that Day, but he told his Followers, That
he did not doubt but that I would be upon my
Way, before he returned from his Sport in the
Evening, and it fell out accordingly; yet so, that I
was but just gone before he came Home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> eleven o’Clock at Night, we came to <i>Ficiminum</i>,
a Town in <i>Hungary</i>, four Miles from <i>Vienna</i>;
there we Supp’d, for our haste was so great
that we came Supperless out of Town; from thence
we travelled towards <i>Comora</i>. The Emperor, among
the rest of his Commands, had enjoin’d me
to take along with me to <i>Buda</i>, one <i>Paul Palinai</i>
from <i>Comora</i>, a Man well acquainted with the Rapins
and Depredations of the <i>Turks</i>, and so was best
able to assist me in my Expostulations with the Bashaw
of <i>Buda</i>, and in my Demands for satisfaction of
Injuries received. But he, not in the least suspecting
that my departure would have been so punctual
at the Day appointed, had not yet stirred from his
own House, and there was no Body could tell when
he would come; which uncertainty troubled me
very much. I acquainted King <i>Ferdinand</i> therewith
by Letter, and all the next Day stayed at <i>Comora</i>
expecting his coming.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the third Day, I passed over the River <i>Vaga</i>,
and prosecuted my Journey towards <i>Gran</i>, the first
Garrison of the <i>Turks</i> I came to in <i>Hungary</i>. Col.
<i>John Pax</i>, Governor of <i>Comora</i> had sent sixteen
Horse with me (of those that the <i>Hungarians</i> call
<i>Hussars</i>) to be my Guard; and he had given them
a Charge not to leave me, till they came in sight of
the <i>Turkish</i> Convoy; for the Governor of <i>Gran</i>
had signified to me, that his Soldiers should meet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
me half way. We travelled about three Hours
through a vast Plain, when, behold! there appeared
afar off four <i>Turkish</i> Horse; and yet, notwithstanding,
my <i>Hungarian</i> Guard accompanied me still,
till I desired them to retire; for I was afraid that if
they should come up to the <i>Turks</i>, some troublesome
Bickering would have intervened betwixt them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the <i>Turks</i> saw me to draw near, they
rode up to me, and saluted me by my Coach side:
thus we passed on a while together, discoursing interchangeably
one with another, (for I had a little
Youth for my Interpreter.) I expected no other
Convoy, but when we descended into a low Valley,
I saw my self on a sudden, surrounded with a Party of
about a hundred and fifty Horse. It was a very pleasant
Spectacle to a Man, unaccustomed to see such Sights,
for their Bucklers and Spears were curiously Painted,
their Sword-handles bedeck’d with Jewels, their
Plumes of Feathers party-coloured, and the Coverings
of their Heads were twisted with round Windings
as white as Snow; their Apparel was Purple-coloured,
or at least a dark Blue; they rode upon
stately Praunsers, adorn’d with most beautiful
Trappings. Their Commanders came up to me,
and after friendly Salutation they bid me Welcome;
and asked me, How I had fared on my Journey? I
answer’d them as I thought fit; and thus they led
me to <i>Gran</i>, for so the Castle is called, situate on
an Hill, whose Foot is washed by the <i>Danow</i>, with
a Town adjoining, built in a Plain. I retired into
the Town, the Arch-bishop whereof is Primate of
<i>Hungary</i>, and for Dignity, Authority and Opulency,
is inferior to no Nobleman of that Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> I was entertained, not after a Courtly,
but after a Military manner; for instead of Beds,
they spread abroad course shaggy Rugs of Tapestry
upon hard Boards; there were no Bed-ticks nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
Sheets: Here my Family had the first taste of <i>Turkish</i>
Delights (forsooth;) as for my self, I fared better,
for my Bed was carried along with me wheresoever
I went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Day after my Arrival, the <i>Sanziac</i> of
the Place (for so the <i>Turks</i> call a Governor, because
a <i>Sanziac</i> (<i>i. e.</i>) a gilded brass Ball, is carried before
him on the top of a Spear, as a Cornet to a
Troop of Horse) was very earnest to speak with
me; and tho’ I had no Letter, nor any other Command
to deliver to him, yet such was his importunity,
that go I must. And when I came, I found
he had no Business with me, but only to see and
salute me, and to ask me something of my Errand;
and thus, exhorting me to promote a Peace, he
wish’d me a happy Journey. In my Passage, I admir’d
to hear the croaking of Frogs in such a cold
Season of the Year as the Month of <i>December</i>; the
cause was, the Waters stagnant in those Places are
made warm by sulphureous Exhalations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> <i>Gran</i>, I went towards <i>Buda</i>; but
to be sure, I took my Breakfast before-hand, which
was likely to be my Dinner also; for there was no
Place to bait at before I came to <i>Buda</i>. The <i>Sanziac</i>,
or Governor of the Place, with all his Family,
together with the Horse which he Commanded,
came out of the Town with me, to bring me on
my Way: I could by no means persuade him to omit
this Office of Respect. The Horse, as soon as
they came out of the Gates, began to shew me some
sport, curvetting and discharging one against another;
they threw their Bonnets on the Ground, and
Galloping their Horses with full speed, by them,
they took them up by the Points of their Spears;
and many such Ludicrous Pranks did they perform.
Amongst the rest of them, there was a <i>Tartar</i>,
who had thick Bushy Hair hanging down over his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Shoulders; they told me, that he always went bare
Headed, and would never have any other Fence
for his Head, either against the Violence of the
Weather, or the Hazard of a Battle, but his own
Hair. The <i>Sanziac</i>, after he had accompanied
me as far as he pleased, returned Home, but not
before we had taken our Leaves of one another,
and he had left some Guides for my Journey, in
my Retinue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I drew near to <i>Buda</i>, a few <i>Turkish
Chiaux</i>’s met me on the Way, (they are in the
Nature of Pursuivants, or Serjeants at Arms, to
carry about the Commands of the Grand Seignior,
or his Bashaw’s, and are Officers of great Esteem in
that Nation) by them, I was brought to lodge in
the House of a Citizen, who was an <i>Hungarian</i>,
where my Baggage, Coach and Horses, was better
provided for, than myself; for the <i>Turks</i> take
special Care that Horses, with their Equipage, be
well accommodated; as for the Men, if they have
but an House over their Heads to shelter them from
the Weather, they think they may shift well
enough for themselves. The Bashaw of <i>Buda</i> sent
one to visit me, and bid me welcome, his Name
was <i>Tuigon</i>, (which in <i>Turkish</i>, signifies a Stork)
by him he excused himself to me, that he could not
admit me into his Presence for some Days, because
of a grievous Disease he laboured under; but as soon
as ever he recovered a little Strength, he said, he
would wait upon me. This Delay was the Occasion,
that the aforementioned Absence of <i>Palinai</i> was
less prejudicial to me, than otherwise it would have
been, (to say no more) for he used great Diligence
to Post after, lest he might come too late, and accordingly
he overtook me a little while after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> was detained at <i>Buda</i> a long Time, by reason
of the Sickness of the Bashaw; ’twas thought his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
Disease was Grief, which he had conceived for the
Loss of a great Sum of Money, which was stolen
from the Place in which he had hid it, for he was
commonly reported to be a Penurious and Sordid-spirited
Man. When he heard, that I had brought
the Heer <i>William Quacquelben</i> with me, a great
Philosopher, and an excellent Physician too, he
earnestly intreated me, that he might give him a
Visit to administer some Physick to him, in order
to his Cure. I easily granted his Request, but
soon after, was almost ready to repent of my Facility:
For the Bashaw grew worse and worse, and,
’twas thought, he would not have recovered; so
that I was afraid, if he had died, the <i>Turks</i> would
say, my Physician had kill’d him, and by that
means, the good Man might have run a great
Hazard, and I myself also might have born Part
of the Infamy, as being accessary thereunto; but
it pleased God to free me from this Anxiety, by
restoring the Bashaw to his Health.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Twas</span> at <i>Buda</i> I got the first Sight of the
<i>Janizaries</i>, so the <i>Turks</i> call the Prætorian Foot;
their Number, when it is fullest, is twelve Thousand,
and their Prince disperses them all over his
Dominions, either to Garrison his Forts against an
Enemy, or to be a Safeguard to <i>Christians</i> and
<i>Jews</i>, against the injurious Rage of the Multitude;
for there is no well Inhabited Village, Town, or
City, wherein there are not some or other of these
<i>Janizarias</i>, to protect <i>Christians</i>, <i>Jews</i>, and other
helpless Persons, from the Fury of the Rabble.
The Castle of <i>Buda</i> is always Garrison’d by them;
their Habit is a long Garment down to their Ankles,
upon their Heads they wear the Sleeve of a Coat,
or Cloak (for from thence, as they say, the Pattern
was drawn) their Head is put into part of it, and
part of it hangs down behind, flapping upon their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
Shoulders; in the Front, or Fore-part of it, there
ariseth a Silver-Cone, somewhat long, gilt over
with Gold, and wrought with Jewels, but they
were of an ordinary Sort. These <i>Janizaries</i> usually
came to me by Couples; when they were admitted
into my Dining-Room, they bowed down their Heads
and made Obeisance, and presently they ran hastily
to me, and touched either my Garment, or my
Hand, as if they would have kissed it; and then
forced upon me a Bundle, or Nosegay of <i>Hyacinths</i>
or <i>Narcissus</i>’s, and presently they retired backward,
with equal Speed, to the Door, that so they might
not turn their Backs upon me, (for that is accounted
undecent, by the Rules of their Order) when
they came to the Door, there they stood, with a
great deal of Modesty and Silence, with their
Hands upon their Breasts, and fixing their Eyes
upon the Ground, so that they seemed more like <i>our</i>
Monks, than <i>their</i> Soldiers. But when I had given
them some Cash (which was the only Thing they
aimed at) they bowed their Heads again, and giving
me Thanks with a loud Voice, they wished
me all happiness, and departed. The Truth is,
unless I had been told before, they were <i>Janizaries</i>,
I should have thought them to have been a kind of
<i>Turkish</i> Monks, or Fellows of some College or
other amongst them. Yet these are the <i>Janizaries</i>
that carry such a Terror with them wheresoever
they come.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> <i>Turks</i> supp’d with me often at <i>Buda</i>,
and were mightily taken with the delicious sweetness
of my Wine: It is a Liquor that they have
but little of in <i>Turkey</i>, and therefore, they more
greedily desire it, and drink it more profusely,
when once they come where it is. They continued
Carousing till late at Night, but afterwards I
grew weary of the Sport, and therefore rose from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Table, and went to my Chamber; but as for
Them, they went away sad, because they had
not their full Swing at the Goblet, but were able to
stand upon their Feet. As soon as I was gone,
they sent a Youth after me, desiring me to let
them have their Fill of Wine, and that I would
lend them my Silver Cups to drink it in; for they
were willing, by my Leave, to sit at it all Night
in some Corner or other of the House. I granted
their Request, and ordered so much Wine to be
given them, as they desired, with Bowls to drink
it in. Being thus accommodated, they tippled it
out so long, till they were even Dead-drunk, and
tumbling down, lay fast asleep upon the Ground.
You must know, that it is a great Crime in <i>Turkey</i>
to drink Wine, especially for those who are well
stricken in Years; as for the Younger Sort, they think
the Offence to be more Venial, and therefore more
excusable in them. But seeing they expect no less
Punishment, after Death, for drinking a little
Wine, than if they drank ever so much, when
once they have tasted of that Liquor, they go on
to drink more and more; for having once incurr’d
the Penalty of their Law, now, they think, they
may Sin <i>gratis</i>, and account Drunkenness as a
Matter of Gain. This Opinion, and others more
absurd than This, do the <i>Turks</i> hold concerning
Wine, of which, I will give you a remarkable
Instance: I saw an Old Man at <i>Constantinople</i>,
who, after he had taken a Cup of Wine in his
Hand to Drink, us’d first to make a hideous Noise;
I asked his Friends, Why he did so? They answered
me, that, by this Outcry, he did, as it were,
warn his Soul to retire into some secret Corner of
his Body, or else, wholly to Emigrate, and pass
out of it, that she might not be guilty of that Sin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
which he was about to commit, nor be defiled with
the Wine that he was to guzzle down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return to <i>Buda</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Twould</span> be too tedious for me to give you a
large Description of this Place, and it were a Task
fitter for one that writes a Book, than a Letter; yet
not to be wholly silent, <i>Buda</i> lies in a pleasant
Place, and in a very fruitful Country, it is extended
all along the Brow of an Hill, so that on one
Side it borders on a rising Ground, abounding with
choice Vineyards, and on the other Side, it is
water’d by the River <i>Danow</i>, running by it, and
beyond the <i>Danow</i>, there is the Town of <i>Pest</i>,
and a large Campain adjoining, both which Prospects
are in View of <i>Buda</i>, so that this Place seems
naturally designed for the Metropolis of <i>Hungary</i>.
It was antiently adorned with many stately Palaces,
belonging to the Nobles of <i>Hungary</i>; but those
goodly Piles are now either quite fallen to the
Ground, or else have many Props to support them
from tumbling down; they are Inhabited mostly
by the <i>Turkish</i> Soldiers, whose daily Pay being but
enough to support them, they have no over-plus to
lay out in Tyling, or Repairing, such large Structures;
and therefore they do not much regard,
whether it Rains through the Roof, or whether the
Walls be full of Clefts, provided they have a dry
Place to set their Horses, and their own Beds in;
the upper Part they think concerns them not, so
that they make a great Part of the upper Stories to
be Inhabited by Weazels and Mice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span>, ’tis a Piece of Religion in <i>Turkey</i>, not
to covet magnificent Buildings; for (say they) ’tis
a Sign of a Proud, Lofty, and aspiring Mind, to
covet Sumptuous Houses, as if so frail a Creature
as Man, did promise a kind of Immortality, and
an everlasting Habitation to himself in this Life;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
when alas! we are but Pilgrims here, and therefore,
ought to use our Dwellings, as Travellers
do their Inns, wherein if they are secured from
Thieves, Cold, Heat, and Rain, they seek not
for any other Conveniences. So that all over
<i>Turkey</i> you will hardly find a stately House, tho’
the Owner of it be never so Great, or Rich a Man;
the Commonalty of them live in Huts and Cottages;
the Nobles are for handsome Orchards, Gardens
and Baths; but as for their Houses, tho’ the
numerousness of their Families require large Ones,
yet they have no handsome Gate-houses, or Porches
belonging to them; nor Court-yards, nor any
thing else Magnificent, or worthy of any Admiration.
Herein they resemble the <i>Hungarians</i>, for
except <i>Buda</i>, and (perhaps) <i>Presburgh</i>, there is
scarce any City in <i>Hungary</i>, that you can call well
Built. This Custom I suppose, they derived from
their Ancestors, for they being a People given to
Camp-discipline and therein trained, did not care a
rush for Building great Houses, but looked upon
their Towns only as temporary Habitations, which
they were about to leave.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, whilst I was at <i>Buda</i>, I was
very much taken with the sight of a strange kind of
Fountain that is without the Gate of the Town, in
the way leading to <i>Constantinople</i>, the Water whereof
at top was boiling hot, and yet in the bottom there
were Fishes playing up and down; so that you would
think, they must needs be throughly boiled, before
you could take them out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Twas</span> the 7th, of <i>December</i>, before the Bashaw
was so well recovered as to admit me to his Presence;
and then, after I had sweetned him with
some Presents, I made my Complaint to him of the
Insolency and Ravagings of the <i>Turkish</i> Soldiers;
and demanded Restitution of what they had wrongfully<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
taken away, contrary to the express of the
Truce made, and which he himself, in his Letter
to <i>Ferdinand</i>, had promised him satisfaction for, if
he pleased to send an Envoy to <i>Buda</i>. But he, like
a cunning Gamester, made as many Complaints of
the Injuries and Losses They had sustained by Our
Soldiers: And as for his Promise to restore the Places
they had wrongfully seized and taken away from
the Emperor; he eluded it, by sheltring himself under
this Dilemma: <i>Either I made a Promise, or I
did not</i>; if I made no Promise, then you can demand
nothing of me: If I did make a Promise, I
know Sir, you are a Person of that Understanding
as not to conceive, that I can, or will perform it;
for I am sent hither by my Master to Enlarge, not
to diminish the Bounds of his Empire; so that I
must by no means make his Condition worse than it
was: ’tis my Master’s Business (Sir) not Mine;
what you have to say on this Head, pray propound
it to him when you come to <i>Constantinople</i>. To be
short Sir, you know I am but newly Recovered,
and therefore am not in a Condition to maintain any
further Discourse. When this course Compliment
was put upon me, I thought ’twas time to be gone,
neither could I get any thing else from him, only a
Truce, till the Grand Seignior’s Mind was known.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> observed, that when I was introduced to the
Bashaw, they observed the old <i>Roman</i> Custom of crying
aloud, <i>Welcome, Welcome</i>: and so wishing an
happy Issue to my Negotiation. I observed also,
that the <i>Turks</i> count the left Hand to be most Honourable
in some particular Cases; the Reason they
give is, because the Sword is worn on that side, and
he that is on the right Hand has, as it were, the
Command of the Sword of him that is at his Left,
whereas his Own is free.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matters</span> being thus composed at <i>Buda</i>, as
well as we could, my Companion <i>Paliani</i> returned
to the Emperor; but I for my part, shipp’d my
Horses, Coaches, and all my Family on some Vessels,
prepared for me on the <i>Danow</i>, and so passed
down the Stream to <i>Belgrade</i>; this was a shorter
cut, and also more secure; for my Journey by
Land to <i>Belgrade</i>, would at that Time have cost
me at least twelve Days, especially, having such a
deal of heavy Baggage with me; and besides, we
had been in danger to be Robb’d by the <i>Heyduc</i>’s,
so the <i>Hungarians</i> call a sort of plundering Thieves
and Robbers; but upon the Water there was no fear
at all of them; and besides, we compassed our Journey
in five Days. The Vessel in which I was,
was drawn along by a lesser Pinnace, in which
there were twenty-four Oars; the other Vessels had
but two large Oars a-piece. The Mariners rowed
Night and Day without any Intermission, excepting
only a few Hours that the poor Souls borrow’d
to Sleep and Eat in. In my Passage down the River,
I could not but observe the venturousness, not
to say temerity of the <i>Turks</i>, who were not afraid
to Sail on in the mistiest Weather and darkest
Night, and when the Wind blew very hard too;
and besides, there were many Water-mills, with several
Trunks and Boughs of Trees hanging over the
Banks, which made our Passage very Dangerous;
so that some times our Vessel, by the boisterousness
of the Wind, was driven to the Bank, and there
dash’d against old stumps of Trees hanging over, so
that it was like to split; this is certain, that she lost
some Planks out of her Hulk, which made a terrible
crack and noise when they were loosed therefrom.
This noise awak’d me; leaping out of my Bed, I
advis’d the Mariners to be more cautious: they lift
up their Voices, and gave me no other Answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
than <i>Alaure</i>, i. e. <i>God will help</i>, and so I might go
to Bed again, if I would.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tho’</span> we speed pretty well, yet I am apt to believe,
that at one Time or other, such Dangerous
Sailing will be fatal to some Passengers. In our
Passage, I saw <i>Tolna</i>, a handsome Town in <i>Hungary</i>;
I cannot forbear to mention it, because there
we had very good White-wine, and, besides the
Inhabitants were very Courteous to us. Moreover,
we passed in sight of the Castle of <i>Walpot</i>, seated on
an Hill, and of other Castles and Towns besides;
we saw also, where the River <i>Drave</i>, on the one
side, and the <i>Tibiscus</i>, or <i>Taise</i>, on the other, made
their Influx into the <i>Danow</i>. As for <i>Belgrade</i> itself,
it is seated at the confluence of the <i>Save</i> and
the <i>Danow</i>; the old City is built in the extreme
Angel of the Promontory, the Building is old, it is
fortified with many Towers, and a double Wall:
Two parts of it are wash’d by the <i>Save</i>, and the
<i>Danow</i>, but on that part where it is joined to the
Land, it hath a very strong Castle on high Ground,
consisting of many loftly Turrets made of square
Stone; before you come into the City, there is
a vast Number of Buildings, and very large Suburbs,
wherein several Nations inhabit, <i>viz.</i> <i>Turks</i>,
<i>Greeks</i>, <i>Jews</i>, <i>Hungarians</i>, <i>Dalmatians</i>, and many
others. For you must know that ordinarily
over all the <i>Turkish</i> Dominions, the Suburbs are larger
than the Towns, but take them both together,
they give the resemblance of large Cities: ’Twas
at this Town, that I first met with some ancient
Coins, wherein, as you know, I take a great delight,
and my Physician aforesaid, Dr. <i>Quackquelben</i>,
fitted me to an Hair, as we say, for he was
as much addicted to those Studies as myself. I found
a great many Pieces, which on one side represented a
<i>Roman</i> Soldier, placed between a Bull and a Horse,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
(for ’tis known, that the Legions of upper <i>Mæsia</i>
did anciently encamp hereabouts) with this Inscription,
<i>Taurunum</i>. This City, in the memory of
our Grandfathers, was twice violently assaulted by
the <i>Turks</i>, first, under <i>Almurath</i>; next under <i>Mahomet</i>,
who took <i>Constantinople</i>; but the <i>Hungarians</i>,
under the Banner of the Cross, made such a
vigorous Defence, that the <i>Barbarians</i> were beaten
off with a great deal of Loss. But at last, in the
Year 1520. <i>Solomon</i>, in the beginning of his Reign,
came before it with a vast Army, and finding it,
either by the neglect of young King <i>Ludovicus</i>, or
by the Discords of the factious <i>Hungarian</i> Nobles,
destitute of a Garrison able to defend it, he took that
opportunity to assault it, and so easily became Master
thereof. And that Door being once opened, an
<i>Iliad</i> of Miseries broke in upon poor <i>Hungary</i>, of
which she is sadly Sensible to this Day; for this Pass
being gained, there followed the Slaughter of King
<i>Lewis Ludovicus</i>, the taking of <i>Buda</i>, the inslaving
of <i>Transilvania</i>, and a flourishing Kingdom, hereby
brought under the Yoke, not without a Terror
struck into the Neighbouring Nations, least they
also should partake of the same Calamities; by
which Example, Christian Princes may take warning,
never to think their Frontier Towns and Castles
to be strong enough, nor sufficiently provided against
so potent an Enemy as the <i>Turk</i>. For the Truth
is, the <i>Ottomans</i> are herein not unlike to great Rivers,
whose Swelling Waves, if they break down
any part of the Bank or Jitty, that keeps them in,
spread far and near, and do abundance of Mischief;
so the <i>Turks</i>, but far more perniciously, having
once broke through the Obstacles that stopt them,
make a vast spoil where-ever they come. But to
return to <i>Belgrade</i>, that I may prosecute the rest of
my Journey to <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had provided myself in that City of
all Things necessary for a Land Journey, I left
<i>Semandria</i>, heretofore a Town or Castle, of the
despots of <i>Servia</i>, on the left side of the <i>Danow</i>;
from whence we Journied towards <i>Nissa</i>. In our way
thither, the <i>Turks</i> shewed us, from the higher
Grounds, the Mountains of <i>Transilvania</i>, with
Snowey Tops, but at a great Distance from us, and
moreover, they pointed with their Fingers, were
the Ruins of <i>Trajans</i> Bridge were: After we had
past the River called <i>Morava</i>, we came to a Town
of the <i>Servians</i>, named <i>Jagodna</i>; there I observed
the Funeral Rites of that Country, which differ
very much from ours, as you may find by this
Relation following.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> dead Body was placed in a Temple, with
the Face uncovered; near it were laid Victuals, as
Bread, Flesh, and a Flagon of Wine: The Wife
and Daughter of the Deceased stood by, in their
best Apparel; the Daughter’s Hat was made of
Peacocks Feathers. The last Boon that the Wife
bestowed on her dead Husband, was a Purple Bonnet,
such as noble Virgins us’d to wear in that
Country. Then we heard their Funeral Plaints,
Mourning and Lamentations, wherein, they asked
the dead Corps, How they came to deserve so ill
at his Hands? Wherein had they been wanting in
their Duty and Observance, that he had left them
in such a lonesome and disconsolate Condition? And
such like Stuff. The Priests that ministred in this
Service, were of the <i>Greek</i> Church. In the Church-Yard,
there were erected on Poles, or long Staves,
several Pictures of Stags, Hinds, and such Kind of
Creatures, cut in Wood; when I asked them the
Reason of this strange Custom, they told us, That
their Husbands, or Fathers, did thereby signify the
Celerity and Diligence of their Wives or Daughters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in managing their Houshold Affairs. Moreover,
by some Sepulchres, there hung Bushes of Hair,
which Women, or Maidens, had placed in Testimony
of their Grief for the Loss of their Relations.
We were also informed, that it was the
Custom of that Country, after Friends on both
Sides had accorded about the Marriage of a young
Couple, for the Bridegroom to snatch away his
Bride, as it were by Force; for they do not think
it handsome, that a Maid should consent to her
own Devirgination, or first Nights Lodging with
her Husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> a small Distance from <i>Jagodna</i>, we met with
a little River which the Neighbouring Inhabitants
called <i>Nissus</i>, and we kept it on our right Hand
almost all the Way till we came to <i>Nissa</i>; yea, and
beyond the Town, upon the Bank thereof (were
there were some Remains of an old <i>Roman</i> Way)
we saw a small Marble Pillar, yet standing, wherein
there were some <i>Latin</i> Letters inscribed; but they
were so defaced, that they could not be read: As
for the Town of <i>Nissa</i>, for that Country, it is a
decent one, and full of Inhabitants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> Time now to acquaint you with the Entertainment
we met with at our Inns, for I believe
you long to know. When I came to <i>Nissa</i>, I
lodged in a public Inn; the <i>Turks</i> call them <i>Caravarsarai</i>,
of which there are a great many in that
Country; the Form of them is thus, it is a large
Edifice, that has more of Length than Breadth; in
the midst of it, there is a kind of Yard for the placing
of Carriages, Camels, Mules and Waggons. This
Yard is compassed about with a Wall about three
Foot high, which joins, and is, as it were, built
in the outward Wall that incloses the whole Building;
the Top of this inner Wall is plain and level,
and is about four Foot broad. Here the <i>Turks</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
lodge, here they sup, and here is all the Kitchen
which they have (for in the ambient Wall before
spoken of, there are ever and anon some Hearths
built) and here are no Partitions between Camels,
Horses, with other Cattel, and Men, but the Space
of that inner Wall; and yet at the Foot of that
Wall, they so tye their Horses, that their Heads
and Necks are above it, or at least may lean over
it; and thus, when their Masters are warming themselves
at the Fire, or else are at Supper, they
stand near them as Servants us’d to do; and sometimes
they will take a Piece of Bread or Apple, or
whatsoever else is offered them, out of their Masters
Hand. Upon the same Wall, the <i>Turks</i> make
their Beds, after this Manner, first of all they spread
a broad Piece of Tapestry, which is fitted as a
Saddle-cloth by Day, for their Horses; upon that
they put their Cloaks, their Saddles serve for a
Pillow, and with the long Vests they wear at Day,
they cover themselves at Night. And thus they
take their rest, never provoking Sleep by any other
Allurement. There is nothing done in secret,
there all is open, and every Body may see what
another does, unless the Darkness of the Night
hinder him. For my Part, I greatly abhored this
Sort of Lodging, because the Eyes of all the <i>Turks</i>
were continually upon us, staring and wondering
at our Carriage, according to the Customs of our
Country. And therefore, I always endeavoured
to lodge at the mean House of some poor Christian!
but alas! their Cottages were so small, that many
Times I had not room enough in them for placing
my Bed; so that sometimes I slept in my Tent,
sometimes in my Coach, and sometimes again I
turned into the <i>Turkish</i> Hospitals; which, to give
them their due, are very convenient, and not unhandsomely
built, for they have several distinct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
Apartments for Lodgings in them. There is no
Man forbid the Use of them, either <i>Christian</i> or
<i>Jew</i>, Rich or Poor, they are open equally to all.
Even the <i>Bashaw</i>’s and <i>Sanziacs</i>, when they travel,
make use of them. In these I thought myself
lodg’d as well as in the Palace of a Prince.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Custom of these Inns, like Hospitals, is
this: They allow Victuals to every particular Man,
that comes in as a Guest: So that when Supper-time
came, there was a Servant that brought in a great
wooden Dish almost as big as a Table; in the middle
of it was a Platter full of Barley boiled to a Jelley,
with a little Piece of Flesh, and about the Platter
were some small Loaves, and here and there a
Piece of an Honey-comb. When I saw this, at
first, out of Modesty, I refused it, saying, that my
Servants were preparing my own Supper for me,
and therefore, advised them to give it to the Poor:
He took it amiss, and prest it upon me, and alledging,
that I should not scorn their slender Provision,
that the Bashaw’s themselves us’d to eat it; it was the
Custom of their Country so to do; they had enough
left to give to the Poor, and if I would not eat
it my self, I should give it my Servants; hereupon,
I was enforced to take it, that I might
not be counted uncivil by them; and after I had
tasted a little of it, I gave him Thanks. The
Relish of it pleased me well, for that kind of
Gruel, as it is commended by <i>Galen</i>, so it is very
wholesome, and not unpleasing to the Taste. Travellers
may be entertained with that kind of Diet
for three Days; but when that Time is expired,
they must pack up and be gone. Here (as I told
you) I was well entertained; but I met not always
with such good Quarters. Sometimes, when I
could not light upon an House, I lodged in a
Stable; my People enquired after a large and capacious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
one, in one part whereof was an Hearth
and a Chimney, and the other part was design’d
for the Herds of Cattle; for that is the Make of
the <i>Turkish</i> Stables, that the Herd and the Herdsman
lodge under the same Roof. I divided that
part where the Fire was from the rest, by the sides
of my Tent, and then I put my Table and my
Bed by the Fire-side, and liv’d like an Emperor: As
for my Family, they wallowed in a great deal of
clean Straw, in the other part of the Stable: But
some of them fell a Sleep by the Fire-side in the
adjoining Orchard or Meadow where a Supper was
preparing; the heat of the Fire was their guard
against the coldness of the Night, and they had as
great a care not to let it go out, as the <i>Vestal Virgins</i>
had of old at <i>Rome</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> suppose, you will ask me, how my Family
relieved themselves against the inconvenience of their
bad Lodging; especially seeing they could have little
Wine in the middle of <i>Turkey</i>, which might
have been some Remedy for their ill Lodging at
Night. For the truth is, there is little Wine to
be had in several of their Villages, especially, if
no <i>Christians</i> dwell among them: For I must tell
you, that the <i>Christians</i> being wearied out with
the Pride and Insolency of the <i>Turks</i>, do many times
withdraw themselves from the common Road into
desert Places; which tho’ they are less fruitful,
yet are more secure; and so leave their better Possessions
to the domineering <i>Turks</i>. And whenever
we drew near to any such Places, where there was
no Wine, the <i>Turks</i> would very fairly tell us of it
before-hand; so that I sent my Steward the Day
before, with a <i>Turk</i> to guide him, to procure some
from the next Villages of the <i>Christians</i>. And by
this means it was, that the Distresses of my Family
were something alleviated; ’tis true, I could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
get any soft Feather-beds or Pillows for them, or
other Blandishments for Sleep; the Wine was instead
of all: As for myself, I had some Flagons of
choice Wine in my Chariot, so that I wanted
none; thus I and my Family were provided for, as
to Wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, there was one Inconvenience, which
troubled us more than the Scarcity of Wine, and
that was, our Sleep was miserably interrupted; for
we being to rise betimes in the Morning, and sometimes
before Day, that we might come the sooner
to our Inns at Night; our <i>Turkish</i> Guides being
deceived by the Light of the Moon, would sometimes
call us up at, or about Midnight, with a
great deal of Noise and Clamour. For the <i>Turks</i>
have no Clocks to distinguish Hours, nor Miles
to shew the Distance of Places: Only they have
a sort of Ecclesiasticks, which they call <i>Talismans</i>;
this sort of People use a kind of Admeasurement by
Water, and when they perceive thereby, that ’tis
Morning, then they cry aloud from an high Tower,
built on purpose, exhorting them to arise and worship
God. They make the same Noise in the
middle between Sun-rise and Noon, and likewise,
between Noon and Sun-set; and, last of all, when
the Sun is set, they cry out with a very shrill
Voice, which hath no unpleasant Modulation, and
which is heard farther than any Body would think.
Thus the <i>Turks</i> divide the Day into four Spaces,
longer or shorter, according to the Season of the
Year: But for the Night-time, they have no certain
Rule at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> our <i>Turkish</i> Guides being deceived by the
exceeding Brightness of the Night they called us
up before Sun-rising, and we started out of our
Beds in great Haste, that so they might not
impute any unlucky Accident, upon the Way, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
our Slothfulness; in the Morning, we pack’d up
our Baggage, and put my Bed and Tent in our
Waggons, harnessed our Horses, and were ready for
our Journey, only expected the Word of Command.
But our <i>Turks</i>, when they found their Mistake,
fairly went into their Nests again, and after we had
waited for them a great while, I sent to them, to
tell them, we were all ready; and now the Delay
was on <i>their</i> Side, my Messengers brought me
Word, from them, that the Moon-light had deceived
them, and therefore, they were gone to sleep
again, for it would be a great while before it would
be Time to go; and they persuaded us to try to
sleep again too. And thus, we must either unpack
all our Things again, to our no small Trouble, or
else, we must endure a great Part of the Coldness
of the Night in the open Air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> prevent this Inconvenience for the future, I
charged the <i>Turks</i> not to be so troublesome any
more, as to rouze me out of my Sleep, for if they
would but tell me over Night, at what Time they
would rise in the Morning, I would be sure to be
ready at the Time appointed; for I had Watches
by me, that I intended to make Use of, which
would not fail to acquaint me with the precise
Hour of the Morning; and if they over-slept themselves,
they should lay it to my Charge, so that
they need not scruple to trust me with the Hour of
their rising. They seemed to be somewhat satisfied
herewith, and yet did not lay aside all their
Solicitude neither; for in the Morning betimes,
they awakened my <i>Valet de Chambre</i>, desiring him
to go to me, and to see how the Index of my
Watches did pointed; he so, and returned Answer
to them, as well as he could, That ’twas
very near Sun-rising, according as he found
it. When they had thus tried him once or twice,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
and found that he hit the Time right, they trusted
me for the future, and admired the Structure of
our Watches, that could so faithfully declare the
Time; so that ever after, we slept out our Sleep,
without any Disturbances from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>Nissa</i> we came to <i>S. Sophia</i>; the Journey
thither, and the Weather, for that Time of
the Year, was very tolerable. <i>Sophia</i> is a Town
big enough, and well inhabited both by Citizens
and Strangers: It was heretofore the Royal Seat
of the King of <i>Bulgaria</i>; and afterwards, if I
mistake not, of the <i>Despots</i> of <i>Servia</i>, whilst that
House stood, before it was overthrown by the
<i>Turkish</i> Arms.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Afterwards</span>, we continued our Journey, for
many Days, through the pleasant, and not unfruitful,
Valley of <i>Bulgaria</i>; all the Time we
were in that Country, we had little other Bread,
but only Cakes bak’d under Ashes upon the Hearth,
which they call <i>Togatch</i>. The Women and Maids
sell them, for they have no Bakers in those Parts;
and when they perceive any Guests a-coming, that
are likely to pay for what they have, presently they
knead a little Dough, with Water, without any
Leaven, and lay it upon Tiles, under the Ashes,
and so bring it out piping hot, and sell them for a
very small Matter; other Victuals is also very cheap
there, a good Weather-sheep may be bought for
thirty-five Aspers; a Chicken and a Hen for
an Asper, a sort of Coin with them, of which
fifty make but a Crown.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> must not omit to acquaint you with the Habit
of these <i>Bulgarian</i> Women. They commonly
wear nothing but a Smock or Shift, made of no
finer Linnen-thread, than that we make Sacks of.
And yet, these course Garments are wrought by
them, with several sorts of strip’d Needle-work,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
after a homely Fashion: With this lose party-coloured
Habit they mightily pleased themselves, so
that when they saw our Shifts, made of the finest
Linnen, yet they wondered at our Modesty, that
we could be contented to wear them without
various Works of divers Colours wrought in
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> that which I most of all admired in them,
was the Tower, which they wore on their Heads,
for such was the Form of their Hats. They were
made of Straw, braided with Webs over them.
The Figure of them differs from the Hats Women
wear in our Country, for ours hang down
on the Shoulders, and the lowest Part of it is the
broadest, and so it rises as it were into a Pyramid
at top; but theirs is narrowest below, and so rises
up like a top, almost nine Inches above the Head;
but that Part of it that looks upwards, towards the
Sky, is both very capacious, and also very open,
so that it seems made to take in Rain, as
ours are to shelter us against them; but in that
Space, interjacent between their upper and lower
Part, their hang Pieces of Coin, little Pictures or
Images, small Parcels of painted Glass, or whatever
is resplendent, though never so mean, which
are accounted very ornamental among them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> kind of Hats makes them look taller,
and also more Matron-like, though they are easily
blown off their Heads, by a blast of Wind, or by
any light Motion they fall off themselves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they appeared to us in this Dress, I
thought they resembled <i>Clytemnestra</i>, or some
<i>Hecuba</i> or other, in the flourishing Time of
<i>Troy</i>, coming upon the Stage. This Sight suggested
to me some pious Meditations, <i>viz.</i> How
frail and mutable a Thing that which is called
<i>Nobleness of Birth</i>, <i>is</i>; for when I asked of some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of these Lasses, they that seemed to be the handsomest
among them, concerning their Stock and
Lineage, they told me, They were descended
from the Chief Nobles of that Country; and
some of them were of a Royal Progeny, though
now it was their Fate, to marry Herdsmen or
Shepherds: For Nobility is very little esteemed
in the <i>Turkish</i> Dominions. For, I my self did
afterwards see at <i>Constantinople</i>, and other Places,
some Descendants from the Imperial Families
of the <i>Catacuzeni</i>, and the <i>Palæologi</i>, living
more contemptuously among the <i>Turks</i>, than ever
<i>Dionysius</i> did of old at <i>Corinth</i>; nay, the <i>Turks</i>
esteem no Men for their Birth, but only for their
own perform’d Accomplishments, excepting only
the <i>Ottoman Family</i>; for that they have a high Veneration,
upon Account of its Original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is thought that these <i>Bulgarians</i> had their
Original from <i>Seythia</i>, near the River <i>Volga</i>, and
that they changed their Habitations and came into
these Parts, when other Nations, either compelled
by Force, or prompted by Choice, changed theirs;
and that they were called <i>Bulgarians</i>, i. e. <i>Volgarians</i>,
from the River <i>Volga</i>, aforesaid. Upon this
Transmigration, they fix’d their Habitation upon
those Parts of Mount <i>Hæmus</i>, that lie between
<i>Sophia</i> and <i>Philippopolis</i>, which are Places naturally
strong; where they, for a long Time, baffled all
the Power of the <i>Grecian</i> Emperors, and killed
<i>Baldwin</i> the Elder, Earl of <i>Flanders</i>, then Emperor
of <i>Constantinople</i>, after they had taken him
in an hot Skirmish. Yet, for all this, they were
not able to resist the Power of the <i>Turks</i>, but
were overcome and miserably enslaved by them.
They use the <i>Illyrian</i>, or <i>Slavonian</i> Tongue, as the
<i>Servians</i> and <i>Rascians</i> also do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> a Man descends into that Plain that
lies over against <i>Philippopolis</i>, he must go through a
Forest and a craggy Mountain, which the <i>Turks</i>
call <i>Carpi Dervent</i>, i. e. <i>The Gate of the strait or
narrow Passage</i>; but in the Plain before-mentioned,
we met with the River <i>Hebrus</i>, having its Original
from the adjoining Mountain <i>Rhodope</i>. Before we
could pass the said Straits, we saw the Top of
Mount <i>Rhodope</i> all cover’d over with deep Snow.
The Inhabitants, as I remember, call it <i>Rulla</i>.
From hence flows the River <i>Hebrus</i>, as <i>Pliny</i> says,
and <i>Ovid</i> also affirms the same in this Distick.</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> which Verses, the Poet seems to intimate the
Shallowness of that River for want of Water. For
though it is a great and famous River, yet, in
most Places it is fordable: For, I remember, in my
return from <i>Constantinople</i>, we forded over it
near <i>Philippopolis</i>, to an Island on the other
Side, where we lay in Tents all Night; but it
happened, that the Waters swelled that Night by
reason of Rain, that next Morning we could
not repass the River, to come into the Road, without
a great deal of Trouble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> City of <i>Philippopolis</i> is situate on one of the
three little Hills, disjoyned, and, as it were, rent from
the rest of the Mountains, and is, as the Grace of
those little Hillocks. While we were at <i>Philippopolis</i>,
we saw Rice growing like Wheat, in the watry
and marshy Grounds. The whole Plain, about
the Town, is full of little round Hills of Earth,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
which the <i>Turks</i> say, were raised on Purpose, as
Monuments of the frequent Battles fought in those
Fields, and the Graves such as were slain there.
From hence, leaving the River <i>Hebrus</i> something
on the Right, and Mount <i>Hæmus</i>, which runs
forth into <i>Pontus</i>, on the left, at last we passed over
the <i>Hebrus</i> on a famous Bridge, made by <i>Mustapha</i>,
and so came to <i>Hadrianople</i>, which the <i>Turks</i> call
<i>Endrene</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> City was formerly called <i>Orestia</i>, before
the Emperor <i>Hadrian</i> inlarged it, and called it by
his own Name. It is seated at the confluence of the
River <i>Mariza</i> or <i>Hebrus</i>, and the two small Currents
of <i>Thinsa</i> and <i>Harda</i>, which there meeting
in a joint Stream run into the <i>Egean Sea</i>. This
City is not very large within the Walls; but,
if you take in the Suburbs, and the Buildings
which the <i>Turks</i> have added without, it is very capacious.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> staid but one Day at <i>Hadrianople</i>, and then
went forward on the last Stage of our Journey towards
<i>Constantinople</i>. In my Way thither there grew
abundance of <i>Narcissus’s Hyacinth’s</i>, and (as the
<i>Turks</i> call them) <i>Tulips</i>, which we beheld, not without
Admiration, that in the midst of Winter, which
is not favourable to such Flowers in other Countries,
the Ground should be so garnished by them.
As for <i>Narcissus’s</i>, and <i>Hyacinths</i>, all <i>Greece</i> abound
with them; and they are so odoriferous, that, by
reason of their Multitude, they are offensive to those
Heads that are unaccustomed to such Kind of
Smells. But the <i>Tulip</i>, hath little or no Smell, but
its gaudiness and party-colouredness is its greatest
Commendation. The <i>Turks</i> are great Admirers
of Flowers, so that, though they are Parsimonious
enough in other Cases, yet for a stately Flower,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
they will not scruple to give some <i>Aspers</i>. And the
Truth is, these kind of Flowers, though they were
presented to me as a Gift, yet they cost me a great
deal of Money; for some <i>Aspers</i> were always expelled
in requital. Neither is there any other way
of treating with a <i>Turk</i>, but by opening the Purse-strings,
as soon as any <i>Christian</i> comes among
them; neither must he think to shut them again,
till he go out of their Country: While he is there,
he must scatter his Coin, and if he get no other
Advantage by it, yet it makes them more tractable.
For the <i>Turks</i> are so ill-natured, and such under-valuers
of all Nations but their own, that without
this Open-handedness, there were no more living
among them, for Strangers, than in the most desolate
and uninhabited Places, by reason of the excessiveness
either of Cold or Heat; but with the
Bait of Liberality, you may catch a <i>Turk</i> at any
Time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the mid-way between <i>Hadrianople</i> and
<i>Constantinople</i>, there is a little Town, called <i>Chiurli</i>,
memorable for the <i>Overthrow</i> which <i>Selimus</i> received
in a Battle against his Father <i>Bajazet</i>, out
of which he escaped by the Swiftness of his Horse,
called <i>Carabonluch</i>, i. e. a <i>Black Cloud</i>, and so fled
to the <i>Cham</i>, or the <i>Precopeian Tartar</i>, who was
his Father-in-Law.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> we came to <i>Selimbria</i>, which is a
Town standing on the Sea-side in our Way, we
saw the Ruins of an old Wall and Ditch, which
were made by the later Emperors of <i>Greece</i>, which
reached from that Sea to the <i>Danow</i>, to secure all
that was contained within that Fortification to the
<i>Constantinopolitans</i>, against the Incursions of the
<i>Barbarians</i>; and there goes a Story, that when
that Wall was a Building, a certain old Man delivered
his Opinion to his Wife, <i>viz.</i> That that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
Wall would not so much secure what was within
it, from the Hands of the Infidels, as it would expose
and subject it to their Rage and Fury, in regard
it would add Courage to the <i>Barbarians</i> to
assault it, and weaken the Courage of the <i>Grecians</i>
to defend it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> <i>Selimbria</i> we had a most pleasant Prospect
of a calm Sea; and ’twas very pleasant to us to
behold the smooth Water, and to gather Cockles
on the Shore; yea, to behold Sholes of <i>Dolphins</i>
sporting in the Water, which, with the Warmness
of the Air, was exceeding delightful. It
can hardly be imagined, how mild the Weather
was in those Parts, though sometimes it be a little
more boisterous at <i>Chiurli</i>; but here there is, as I
may call it, a <i>Thracian Gale</i>, and an incredible
Sweetness of Air.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we came near to <i>Constantinople</i>, we
passed over two pleasant Arms of the Sea, upon a
Bridge built over them. I may safely say, That
if those Places were cultivated by Art, as they are
naturally pleasant, the Sun never shone on a better
Country; but, alas! they seem to mourn for the
Neglect put upon them by the insulting <i>Barbarian</i>.
Here we had our Fill of choice Sea-fishes, which
were even taken in our Sight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I lodged in those Inns the <i>Turks</i> call
<i>Imaret</i>, I usually observed, that the Cracks of the
Walls were all full of Pieces of Paper; and thinking
something was the Matter, but not knowing
what, I took out some of them, and finding nothing
writ therein of any Consequence, I was more
earnest to know of the <i>Turks</i> the Reason of their
so doing; especially as I had observed the same
Thing in other Places of <i>Turkey</i> before. At first
they scrupled to tell me, as thinking perhaps that
I would not believe them; or else, not being willing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
to impart so great a Mystery of Things to
such an Alien as myself. This made me the
more inquisitive, till at last some of them, with
whom I became more familiar, told me, That the
<i>Turks</i> gave a great deal of Difference to Paper, because
the Name of God may be written in it:
And, therefore, they will not suffer the least Bit
of Paper to lie upon the Ground, but presently
they take it up, and thrust it into some Chink or
Hole or other, that so it may not be trampled under
Foot; and hitherto, perhaps, their Superstition
may be tollerable, but mark what follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Day of Judgment, say they, when
<i>Mahomet</i> shall call up his Followers from their <i>Purgatory</i>,
(to which they were condemned for their
Sins) to Heaven, to be there made Partakers of
Eternal Blessedness; there will no Way be left for
them to come to their Prophet, but over an huge
red-hot Iron Grate, which they must run over
bare-foot, (how painfully, you may guess, when
you imagine a Cock to skip thro’ hot-burning
Coals.) But at that Instant, (believe it if you
can!) all those Bundles of Papers, which they
have preserved from being trod upon, will immediately
appear, and put themselves under their
Feet; by which Means they will pass the red-hot
Iron-Grate with less Damage; so necessary do they
count the Work of saving a little Paper. And, to
add to the Story, I remember that my <i>Turkish</i>
Guides were once very angry with my Servants,
for making use of Paper to cleanse their <i>Posteriors</i>,
and thereupon made a grievous Complaint to me
of their horrid Offence therein: I had no Way to
put them off, but by telling them, ’twas no Wonder
my Servants did such strange Things, seeing
they also used to eat Swines Flesh, which the <i>Turks</i>
abhor. Thus I have given you a Taste of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
<i>Turkish</i> Superstition; I shall add, That they account
it a damnable Sin, if any of their own
People chance (though unwillingly) to sit upon
the <i>Alcoran</i>, (which is a Book containing the Rites
of their Religion) and, if a <i>Christian</i> do it, ’tis
Death by their Law. Moreover, they will not
suffer <i>Rose-Leaves</i> to lie upon the Ground, because,
as the Ancients did fable, the Roses
spring out of the Blood of <i>Venus</i>; so the <i>Turks</i>
hold, That it had its Rise from the Sweat of <i>Mahomet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> came to <i>Constantinople</i> on the 20th Day of
<i>January</i>, and there found my Collegues above-mentioned,
<i>Anthony Wrantzius</i> and <i>Francis Zay</i>;
as for the <i>Grand Seignior</i> himself, he was, at that
Time, at the Head of his Army in <i>Asia</i>, and had
only left at <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>Ebrahim Bashaw</i>, an
Eunuch, as Governor of the City, and <i>Rustan</i>,
but deprived of his Vizier-ship; however I gave
him a Visit and made him Presents, as being mindful
of his former Dignity, and of the fair Prospect
there was of his speedy Restitution thereunto.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may, perhaps, divert you, and besides it is
not wholly foreign to my Design, to acquaint you
how this <i>Rustan</i> came to be strip’d of all his former
Honours. Know then, That <i>Solyman</i> had
a Son, called <i>Mustapha</i>, on a Concubine of his,
born by the <i>Bosphorus</i>, (if I mistake not.) This
Youth was in the prime of his Age, and in great
Favour among the Soldiers. But the same <i>Solyman</i>
had several other Children by <i>Roxolana</i>, whom
he doated on so much, that he made her his Wife,
by appointing her a Dowry; for that’s the Way
of making and confirming a Marriage among the
<i>Turks</i>. This <i>Solyman</i> did, contrary to the Custom
of former Emperors, none of which had ever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
married a Wife, since the Days of <i>Bajazet</i> the
Elder; the Reason was, because the said <i>Bajazet</i>,
being overthrown by <i>Tamerlane</i>, was, with his
Wife, taken Prisoner by him, where he suffered
many Indignities, but none affected him more,
than the Uncivilities and Reproaches which he
saw offered to his <i>Sultaness</i>, before his Face. The
Memory of which Affronts made such a deep Impression
on all those that succeeded <i>Bajazet</i> in the
Empire, that, to this very Day, none of them will
marry a Wife, that so, whatever Chance should
happen, they might never fall into the like Indignity;
so that, ever since, they beget Children on
Women of a servile Condition, in whose Misfortunes
they may be less concerned, than if they
were their lawful Wives. And yet the Children
begot on such Concubines, are as much esteemed
by the <i>Turks</i>, as if they were born in lawful
Wedlock, and they have as much right to their
Fathers Estates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">So</span> then, <i>Mustapha</i>, being of a promising Ingenuity,
and in the Flower of his Age; and besides,
being the Darling of the Soldiers, and the
common People too, having so many favourable
Circumstances attending him, he, after his Father’s
Death, was by the Votes of all designed for his Successor
in the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other Side, his Stepmother, <i>Roxalana</i>,
with Might and Main, laboured to prevent it, and
to secure the Empire for the Children begotten on
her own Body, and thereupon presuming on her
Marriage-Relation, she ceased not to disparage
<i>Mustapha</i>, and to prefer a younger Son of her own
before him. In this Design <i>Rustan</i> was both
her Counsellor, and Assistant; they drew both
in one Yoke, for <i>Rustan</i> having married a Daughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
of <i>Solyman</i>’s, by <i>Roxalana</i>, their Interests
thereupon were reciprocal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> <i>Rustan</i> was the Chief of the Bashaw’s, and
<i>Solyman</i>’s Prime Vizier, having the chief Power
and Authority with him: He was a Man of a
sharp and very capacious Wit, and a great Grace
to <i>Solyman</i>’s Government. As for his Original,
he was the Son but of a Shepherd, and yet he
seemed worthy of that Dignity to which he was
advanced, if his sordid Avarice had not been a
Blot in his Escutcheon. And to speak truly, <i>Solyman</i>
himself observed this Vice in him, though
upon all other Accounts, he was his choice and
only Favourite: And yet this Crime of his turned
to his Master’s Advantage; for being appointed by
<i>Solyman</i> to preside over his Treasury, or Exchequer,
which sometimes was very low, he was so
thrifty in the Management of that Office, that he
did not spare to raise Money, even by the meanest
and most contemptible Ways. For he laid a Tax
on Herbs, Roses, and Violets, which grew in great
Men’s Gardens; he caused the Armour, Coats of
Mail, Warrior’s Horses, of such as were taken
Prisoners in War, to be sold, and by such Ways
as those he got together such a Mass of Money,
that <i>Solyman</i> was very secure on that Part; upon
this Occasion, I remember, that a great Man among
the <i>Turks</i>, who are usually vindictive enough,
that was a great Enemy to <i>Rustan</i>, yet (to my
Surprize) told me, That he would do <i>Rustan</i> no
hurt, tho’ it were never so much in his Power,
because his Care and Industry had advanced his
Master’s Treasury to so prodigious a Sum. There
is a Chamber in the <i>Seraglio</i>, at <i>Constantinople</i>,
over which there is this Inscription, <i>Here is the Cash
obtained by the Diligence of <span class="antiqua">Rustan</span></i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Rustan</i> was Grand Vizier, and had the
intire Administration of all Things in his Hands,
he was able to turn his Master’s Mind, as
he pleased, so that ’twas commonly reported
among the <i>Turks</i>, That partly by the Accusation
of <i>Rustan</i>, and partly by the Witchcraft
of his Wife <i>Roxolana</i>, (for she was accounted little
better than a Sorceress) <i>Solyman</i> was so alienated
from his Son <i>Mustapha</i>, that he took Counsel to
put him to Death. As to what some alledge, that
<i>Mustapha</i> being sensible of the Designs of <i>Rustan</i>
and his Step-Mother <i>Roxolana</i>, against his Life, did
labour to preserve them, by taking off his Father,
and so seizing the Empire by force; very few do
believe that Story, but look upon it as a Fiction.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> this Occasion, let me tell you, that the Sons
of the <i>Turkish</i> Emperors are the miserablest Creatures
in the World; for if any one of them succeed
his father in the Empire, the rest are inevitably put
to Death by him. For the <i>Turks</i> cannot endure any
Corrival in Government; and besides they are egged
on to this severity by their <i>Prætorian</i> Bands,
(<i>Janizaries</i> and <i>Spahies</i>) who, as long as there is
any one of the <i>Grand Seigniors</i> Brothers alive, never
cease craving of Largesses and Boons, and if the
present Emperor refuses to grant them, they presently
cry out, <i>God save your Brother, God send
your Brother a long Life</i>; by which Words, they
more than intimate their Wishes, that he were on
the Throne. So that the <i>Turkish</i> Emperors are in
a manner compelled to put their Brethren to Death,
and so begin their Reign with Blood. But <i>Mustapha</i>
was afraid of such a fatal end; or else <i>Roxolana</i>
was willing to translate the said Destiny from
her own Children upon <i>Mustapha</i>: Upon one or
other of these Grounds, it was, that <i>Solymon</i> entertain’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
the thought of putting his Son <i>Mustapha</i> to
Death. And the occasion fell out opportunely, for
he had War at that Time, with <i>Sagthama</i> King
of the <i>Persians</i>, thither <i>Rustan</i> was sent with a vast
Army. When he drew near to the Borders of <i>Persia</i>,
upon a sudden he made a stop, and wrote back
fearful Missives to <i>Solyman</i>, telling him, <i>That the
whole Empire was in great hazard, there was nothing
but Treason studied in the Army, they all cry’d
out <span class="antiqua">A Mustapha! A Mustapha!</span> yea, the Disease
was grown to such a height, that ’twas past his skill
to cure it; and therefore the Emperor himself must
come immediately, if he would have the Crown sit safe
on his Head.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Solyman</i></span> was mightily disturb’d at the News, and
therefore posted away for the Army, and sends
Letters to <i>Mustapha</i> to come to him, to purge
himself from those Crimes, whereof he was formerly
suspected, but now openly accused; if he could
do it, he told him, he need not fear to approach
his Presence. Upon the Receipt of this Letter,
<i>Mustapha</i> was in a great Streight, if he should go
to his Father, in such an angry Mood, he ran upon
his Death; if he refused, that would be interpreted,
as a plain Confession of the objected
Crimes. Under this Dilemma, he resolved upon
that course, which as it had more of Resolution
in it, so it was fullest of Danger. Away
goes he from <i>Amasia</i>, of which he was
Governor, to his Father’s Camp, which was pitch’d
not far from the place. This he did either out of
confidence of his own Innocency, or else presuming
on the Assistance of the Army, if any Severity
were meditated against him; whatever was the
Motive of his Journey, this is certain, that he
run unavoidably upon his own Destruction; For
<i>Solyman</i> ever since he was at <i>Constantinople</i>, had resolved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
to put his Son to Death; and to make the
Matter more plausable, he consulted the <i>Mufty</i>,
(so the <i>Turks</i> call the chief of their Priests, as <i>Romanists</i>
call theirs the Pope,) and that he might not
speak to him in favour of <i>Mustapha</i>, he propounded
to him a feign’d Case, thus, ‘There was a
Wealthy Merchant at <i>Constantinople</i>, who having
occasion to Travel a long Journey from Home,
left the care of his Family, his Wife and Children,
and all his Affairs to a Slave of his, in
whose Fidelity he put a great deal of Confidence;
now this Slave, immediately after his departure,
designed to destroy his Masters Wife and Children,
committed to his Care, and Embezil his
Estate, and to work against his Masters own
Life, in case he should ever get him into his
Power; What may be Lawfully done, said he,
to the <i>Mufty</i>, with such a Slave.’ <i>He deserves</i>
says the <i>Mufty</i> <i>to be Rack’d to Death.</i> Whether
he spoke really as he thought, or whither he did
not do it to curry favour with <i>Rustan</i> and <i>Roxolana</i>;
This is certain, that the Resolution of the
<i>Grand Seignior</i> was greatly confirmed thereby to put
his Son to Death, for he was of Opinion, <i>Mustapha</i>’s
Offence against him, was as great, as that supposed
Slaves against his Master. However it were,
<i>Mustapha</i> came into his Fathers Camp, the whole
Army being very sollicitous about the event of their
Congress.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Soon</span> after he was brought into his Fathers
Tent, where all things were hush; not a Soldier
of the Guards to be seen, no Serjeant, no Executioner
in view, nor nothing of Treachery that was
visible; but when he was come into an inner Tent,
Lo! upon a sudden, there started up four Mutes,
strong and lusty Fellows to be his Executioners;
they set upon him with all their strength and might,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and endeavoured to cast a Cord about his Neck; he
defended himself stoutly for a while, (for he was a
Robust young Man,) as if he had contended not
only for Life, but for the Empire. For without
Question, if he had escaped that danger, and had
come in among the <i>Janizaries</i>, they either out
of Affection to him, whom they dearly Loved;
or else moved with the Indignity of the Thing,
would not only have saved his Life, but have gone
near to have Proclaimed him Emperor: And that
was the very thing, which <i>Solyman</i> fear’d of all
things in the World; and therefore perceiving, as
he stood behind a Linnen Vail in the Tent to behold
the Tragedy, that unexpected stop was put to
his Bloody Design; he peep’d out his Head, and
gave the Mutes such a sour and minacious Look, in
reproach of their remisness; thereupon they assaulted
him with renew’d Force, and then threw poor
<i>Mustapha</i> down on the Ground, and Strangled
him; and after they had done, they carried his
Corps out of the Tent, and laid it on a piece of
Tapestry, that so the <i>Janizaries</i> might behold
their design’d Emperor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as the Matter was divulged, Commiseration
and Grief seized on the whole Camp, and
there was scarce a Man of any Consideration in
the whole Army, that did not approach to behold
so sad a Spectacle, especially the <i>Janizaries</i>, whose
Confirmation and Rage was such, that they would
have ventured to attempt any Manner of Mischief
whatsoever, if they had had a Leader. As for
him whom they hoped to be their Conductor, he
lay dead on the Ground, and therefore now there
was no Way but one, to take that patiently which
was past all Remedy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> they silently departed with blubber’d Eyes,
and sad Hearts, to their Tents, where they both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
lamented and pitied the woful Fate of unhappy
<i>Mustapha</i>, sometimes inveighing against the Madness
and Rage of his old doating Father, at other
Times exclaiming at the Fraud and Cruelty of his
Step-Mother, and anon cursing the Wickedness of
<i>Rustan</i>, with direful Imprecations for extinguishing
so great a Light of the <i>Ottoman</i> Family, so that
all that Day was a Fasting-day to them, they did
not sip so much as a drop of Water; yea, some
of them continued their Abstinence for many Days
after. In short, there was such a Face of Mourning
over the whole Army, which was not like to
cease in many Days, that <i>Solyman</i> in Policy, and
in a seeming Compliance with the Sentiments of
his People, deprived <i>Rustan</i> of his Office (it being
thought by his own Consent) and Banished him,
as a private Person to <i>Constantinople</i>, substituting
<i>Achmat</i> Bashaw to the <i>Grand-Vizier-ship</i> in his
Room, a Man of more Courage than Conduct.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> this Alteration, the public Grief was
somewhat abated, and the Soldiers Rage pacified;
for the Commonalty was made to believe, That
<i>Solyman</i> at last had found out the Wickedness of
<i>Rustan</i>, and the Inchantments of his Wife; and
that now he repented, though it were late, first of
his Cruelty to <i>Mustapha</i>. and thereupon had banished
<i>Rustan</i> from his Presence, and that he would
not spare his Wife neither, as soon as he came to
<i>Constantinople</i>. As for <i>Rustan</i>, he pretended great
Sorrow, and departed to <i>Constantinople</i>, without
seeming to have the least hope, ever to be restored
to his former Dignity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> alas! <i>Roxolana</i> was not content with the
Destruction of <i>Mustapha</i>, as long as he had an only
Son, who was yet in his Minority, alive; for she
did not think her own, or her Childrens Security,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
to be sufficiently provided for, as long as any
of <i>Mustapha</i>’s Race were alive; but she wanted
a fair pretence to accomplish her Design, nor was
it long before she found One. She represented
to <i>Solyman</i>, that as often as his Grand-child,
<i>Mustapha</i>’s Son went abroad at <i>Prusa</i>, where he
was brought up, the Youth of that City were
wont to flock about him, to wish him all Happiness,
and particularly to pray, <i>That he might long
survive his Father</i>. And whither (said she) can this
tend, but to prompt him to mount the Throne,
and revenge his Father’s Death? And to be sure,
the <i>Janizaries</i> will take his Part, (added She;) and
thus the Death of <i>Mustapha</i> alone, will add little
Security to the public Peace and Tranquility. Religion
(proceeded she) is to be preferred before even
the Lives of our own Children; and seeing that of
the <i>Musselmans</i>, (for so they call their Religion, as
counting it the best) stands and falls with the <i>Ottoman</i>
Family; if that House fail, farewel Religion
also. And how can that House stand, if Domestic
Discord undermine it? And therefore Sir, if you
prevent the Ruin of your House, your Empire
and your Religion, you must use all manner of
means; nay, you must not stick at Parricide itself;
if homebred Disagreement and Feud may be
thereby prevented; for the safety of Religion will
over-ballance the Loss, even of a Man’s own Children.
As for <i>Mustapha</i>’s Son, you have the less
Reason to spare him, because his Father’s Crime
hath already infected him, and there is do doubt,
but, if he be suffered to Live, he will soon endeavour
to Head a Party, to revenge his Father’s Death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> these Reasons <i>Solyman</i> was induced to yield
to the Murder of his Grandchild, and thereupon
sent <i>Ebrahim</i> Bashaw to <i>Prusa</i>, to destroy the innocent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
Youth. As soon as the Bashaw came thither,
he made it his great Business to conceal his
intended Design from the Child’s Mother; for,
he thought, it would be look’d upon as an inhuman
Thing in him, to cut off a Youth, with the
Privity of his Mother, and, as it were, before her
Eyes. And, besides, he was afraid the People
would rise in Arms upon the Perpetration of so
cruel a Fact; and therefore at first, Fox like, he
sets his Wits at work to deceive the Mother. He
pretended that he was sent by <i>Solyman</i>, out of Respect
to her and her Son, to visit them; that his
Master saw his Error in putting his Son to Death,
which he now, too late repented of; but that the
crueller he had been to the Father, the more indulgent
he would be to his Son; and many such
colloguing Words he used, whereby he imposed
upon the too credulous Mother, who was the rather
induced to believe him, because of <i>Rustan</i>’s
Disgrace and Fall; and to crown his Flattery, he
presented them with many Gifts. This past on
for a Day or two, and then some Discourse was
administred concerning their going abroad, out of
the City, to enjoy the fresh Air. And the Bashaw,
being an Eunuch, persuaded her the next
Day to take a Turn in the Suburbs, she in her
Coach, and himself, with her Son, would ride afore
on Horseback. The Matter seemed not to
afford any Suspicion, and therefore she consented,
and a Chariot is prepared for her; but (mark the
Fraud!) the Axle-Tree of the Coach was so
made, on Purpose, that it must needs break, when
it came to be jogged in any rough Way. Thus
she, in an unlucky Time, began her Journey out
of the City. The Eunuch and the Child rode a
pretty Way before, as if they had Occasion for
some private Discourse, and the Mother speeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
after as fast as she was able; but when the Coach
came to the designed craggy Place, the Wheel violently
hit against the Rocks, and so the Axle-Tree
broke. This the Mother looked upon as
an unlucky Omen, and therefore, in a great Fright,
she could not long be restrained from leaving her
Coach, and with a few of her Maids, from following
her Son on Foot. But, alas! ’twas too
late; for the Eunuch being come to the House
designed for the Slaughter, without any more ado,
shewed the Child the Emperor’s Mandate for
his Death. He answered, according to the Principles
of their Religion, That he looked upon that
Command as proceeding not from the Emperor,
but from God, which must necessarily be obeyed,
and so he yielded his Neck to the Bow-String.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> died this innocent and hopeful Youth.
When the Eunuch had perpetrated this wicked
Fact, he stole out at a Back-door, and fled as fast
as he could. The Mother, soon after, beginning
to smell out the Fraud, knocks at the Door; when
they thought fit they opened it, and there she saw
her Son sprawling on the Ground, his Breath being
yet hardly out of his Body. Here let me draw
a Vail; for a Mother’s Affection to a Son in such
a lamentable Juncture, may be better conceived
than expressed. Upon this dismal Sight she was
hurried back to <i>Prusa</i>, where she tore her Hair,
rent her Garments, filled the whole Town with
Howlings, Moans, &amp;c. The <i>Prusian</i> Ladies,
with their Daughters and Waiting-Maids,
came in Multitudes to her, and were stark Mad to
hear of so great a Butchery; and running in that
raving Manner out of the Gates, all the Cry was,
<i>Where’s the Eunuch? Where’s the Eunuch? Let’s
have him to tear him to pieces</i>: But he foreseeing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
what would happen, and fearing, like another <i>Orpheus</i>,
to be torn Peace-meal by those raging Furies,
had cunningly withdrawn himself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return to my Purpose. As soon as I
came to <i>Constantinople</i>, Letters were sent to <i>Solyman</i>,
then at <i>Amasia</i>, to acquaint him with my
Arrival; and, till his Answer was return’d, I had
Leisure to take a View of the City of <i>Constantinople</i>;
and first, I had a Mind to visit the Temple
of St. <i>Sophia</i>, which I was not admitted to do,
but by special Favour; for the <i>Turks</i> think that
their Temples are prophaned, if a <i>Christian</i> do but
put his Foot within them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Church is a magnificent Pile, and a
worthy Structure to behold. It hath a great Arch
or Hemisphere in the Middle, which hath no Light
but only from the Sky: All the <i>Turkish Mosks</i> are
built after the Form of this. Some say, that heretofore
it was much larger, and contained many
Apartments, which were all destroyed by the
<i>Turks</i>, and only the <i>Quire</i> and <i>Nave</i>, in the Middle
of it, standing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the Situation of the City itself, it seemed
to me, to be naturally placed as fit to be the Mistress
of the World; it stands in <i>Europe</i>, and hath
<i>Asia</i> in view, and on its right, hath <i>Egypt</i> and <i>Africa</i>;
which, though Countries not adjacent to it,
yet by reason of frequent Intercourse and Naval
Commerce, they seem as it were, contiguous. On
its left Hand is the <i>Euxin Sea</i>, and the <i>Palus Mætis</i>,
whose Banks are inhabited round about by
many Nations, and so many navigable Rivers have
their Influx into them, that there is nothing grows
in any of the Countries thereabout, fit for Man’s
Use; but there is a great Conveniency of transporting
it by Sea to <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the one Side, it is wash’d with the <i>Propontis</i>;
on the other, the River makes an Haven, which
<i>Strabo</i> calls, <i>The Golden Horn</i>, from the Similitude
it hath to an Horn; on the other Side, it is joined
to the rest of the Continent, so that it almost resembles
a Peninsule; and with the continued back
of a Promontory, it runs out into the Sea and a
Bay, which is made there by the River and the Sea.
So that from the middle of <i>Constantinople</i>, there is
a most pleasant Prospect into the Sea, and even to
the Mount <i>Olympus</i>, in <i>Asia</i>, which bears a snowy
Head all the Year long. The Sea there, is wonderful
full of Fish, which sometimes swim down
from the <i>Mæotis</i> and the <i>Euxine</i>, through the <i>Bosphorus</i>
and <i>Propontis</i>, into the <i>Ægæan</i> and <i>Mediterranean
Seas</i>, and sometimes they swim from
thence into the <i>Euxin</i>, according to the Nature of
the Fish; and that in Shoals so thick and numerous,
that you may catch them with your Hands.
So that here is excellent fishing for <i>Mackrel</i>, <i>Tunny</i>,
<i>Cod</i>, <i>Porpois</i> and <i>Sword-Fish</i>. But the <i>Greeks</i> fish
more than the <i>Turks</i>, though these latter love Fish
well enough; provided, they be of the Number of
those, which they count <i>clean</i>; as for others, they
had rather eat Poison than taste them, for a <i>Turk</i>
had rather his Tongue or his Teeth were pluck’d
out of his Head, than taste of any Thing they
think to be <i>unclean</i>, as a <i>Frog</i>, a <i>Snail</i>, or a <i>Tortoise</i>.
And herein, the <i>Greeks</i> are every jot as Superstitious
as they; of which I will give you the
Instance following.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> entertain’d in my Family, a Youth of the
<i>Greek</i> Religion; I employed him as my Steward.
The rest of my Servants could never persuade him
to eat any <i>Periwinkles</i> or <i>Cockles</i>; but at last, they
put a Trick upon him; they caused them to be
so high-season’d and disguis’d, that he, mistaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
them for another sort of Fish, fed upon them most
heartily. Whereupon, my People set up a Laughter,
and threw down the Shells before him, where
by he perceiv’d himself to be cozen’d: Whereupon,
’tis incredible to relate how much he was
troubled. He went presently to his Chamber, and
there fell a Vomiting, Weeping, and Afflicting
himself most grievously, without any Intermission;
insomuch, that two Months Sallary was not sufficient
to expiate this Offence; for that’s the Guise
of <i>Greek</i> Priests, according to the kind and greatness
of the Offence, they lay a pecuniary Mulct
upon those who come to <i>Confess</i>, and they never
<i>Absolve</i> them till they pay it down to a Penny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the furthest Point of that Promontory which
I mentioned before, stands the Palace, or <i>Seraglio</i>,
of the <i>Turkish</i> Emperors: To me, it did not seem
very magnificent, either for Work or Workmanship
(for you must know, that as yet, I had not
made an Entrance into it.) Under the Palace, in
a low Ground, and as it were, upon the Sea-shore,
are the Gardens of the <i>Grand Seignior</i>, where the
greatest Part of <i>Old Bysantium</i> is thought to have
stood.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> hope you do not expect to be informed by me,
why the <i>Chalcedonians</i>, who built a City over-against
<i>Byzantium</i> (the Ruins whereof are yet to
be seen) were Sirnam’d <i>The Blind</i>; nor shall I
tell you the Nature of that Sea, which always runs
downward with a vast Stream, but never recoils
with any Tide; nor will I spend Time to speak
of those <i>Hautgis</i> which were brought to <i>Constantinople</i>
from the <i>Palus Mæotis</i>, such as the <i>Italians</i>
call <i>Moronella’s Botargues</i> and <i>Caviare</i>; the Description
of all these Particulars would swell my
Epistle to too great a Bulk, and besides, it would
be needless; for both the <i>Antients</i>, and also <i>Modern</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
Writers, have given Information of those Particulars
at large.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> return then to the Site of <i>Constantinople</i>.
There is no Place in the World more pleasantly
seated to the Eye, nor more convenient for Trade.
But, let me tell you, the Buildings therein (as
in all other <i>Turkish</i> Cities) are not magnificent, nor
are their Streets stately or large; nay, in <i>Constantinople</i>,
they are so narrow, that they much eclipse
the Beauty of the Place. Yet there are in it some
valuable Relicks of old Monuments to be seen;
but not so many as a Man would imagine, considering
how many <i>Constantine</i> brought thither from
<i>Rome</i>. It is not my Purpose to insist upon each of
these Particulars; yet, a Word or two of the principal
ones.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the <i>Area</i> of the old <i>Hippodrome</i>, there are
two Serpents cut in Brass; as also, a mighty <i>Obelisk</i>.
Moreover, <i>Constantinople</i> doth gratifie us with the
Sight of two memorable Pillars; <i>One</i> over-against
the <i>Caravaserai</i>, where I lodged, and the <i>Other</i>
in the <i>Forum</i>, called by the <i>Turks</i>, <i>Aurat-basar</i>,
i. e. <i>The Womens Court</i>, wherein, from Bottom
to Top, is engraven the History of a certain Expedition
of one <i>Arcadius</i>, who built it, and whose
Statue, for a long time, stood on the Top of it. And
yet it may rather be called a <i>Stair-Case</i>, than a
<i>Pillar</i>, because it goes winding up like a Pair of
Stairs. I caused the Shape of this Pillar to be drawn,
which I have by me. But the other Pillar, over-against
the House the <i>German</i> Ambassadors used
to lodge in, the whole Structure, besides the Basis
and the Chapiter, consists of eight solid Marble or
Red <i>Porphyry</i> Stones, so curiously joined together,
that they seem but one continued Stone. For,
where the Stones are jointed one into another, upon
that Commissure, there is wrought a circular Garland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
of Lawrels round about the Pillar, which
hides the jointing, so that they which look upon it
from the Ground, perceive no jointing at all. That
Pillar hath been so often shaken by Earthquakes, and
so battered by Fires happening near it, that it is
cleft in many Places, and they are forced to bind it
about with Iron Hoops, that it may not fall to
pieces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> say, That the Statue of <i>Apollo</i> once
stood upon that Pillar, and that afterwards the
Statues of <i>Constantine</i>, and of <i>Theodosius</i> the Elder,
were erected there; but they are all thrown down,
either by the Force of the Winds, or by Earthquakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Greeks</i> tell this Story concerning the <i>Obelisk</i>,
in the <i>Hippodrome</i>, which I mentioned before,
<i>viz.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> it fell from its Basis, and lay for many
Ages upon the Ground; but in the Time of the
later Emperors, there was an Architect found, who
undertook to raise it up to its Place; but he demanded
a vast Reward for his Pains. After the Price
was agreed on, he prepared abundance of Ropes,
Pullies, and other Instruments, and by those means,
he lifted up that vast Stone, within one Inch of the
Place where it was to stand; but his present <i>Apparatus</i>
being able to raise it no higher, the People,
who in great Numbers were his Spectators, were of
Opinion, that all his former Cost and Pains were
lost, and he must begin anew to try to do the Feat
some other way, to his vast Expence and Charge.
The Artist himself was not discouraged; but being
skilful in <i>Mechanick Philosophy</i>, he caused abundance
of Water to be brought up to him, which, for many
Hours, he cast upon the Ropes, to which the <i>Obelisk</i>
hung; and those Ropes, being often wet and
dry, shrunk a little, and by that means, lifted up<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
the Weight to its designed Station, to the great
Admiration and Applause of the Vulgar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> <i>Constantinople</i> I saw several Sorts of wild
Beasts, such as <i>Lynxes</i>, <i>Cat-a-Mountains</i>, <i>Panthers</i>,
<i>Leopards</i>, and <i>Lyons</i>; but they were so
gentle and tame, that I saw one of the Keepers
pull a <i>Sheep</i> out of a <i>Lyon</i>’s Mouth, so that he
only moistened his Jaws with the Blood, without
devouring it. I saw also a young <i>Elephant</i>, so
wanton, that he would dance, and play at Ball.
Sure you cannot chuse but laugh, when I tell you
of an <i>Elephant</i>’s dancing and playing at Ball; but
if I should say no more, why may you not believe
me as well as <i>Seneca</i>, who tells us of one that
could dance upon the Rope? Or as <i>Pliny</i>, who
speaks of another that understood <i>Greek</i>? But that
you may not think me an egregious Forger, give
me leave to explain myself: When this <i>Elephant</i>
was bid to dance, he did so caper or quaver with
his whole Body, and interchangeably move his
Feet, that he seemed to represent a kind of a Jig;
and as for playing at Ball, he very prettily took up
the Ball in his Trunk, and sent it packing therewith,
as we do with the Palm of the Hand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> those wild Beasts, there had been a
<i>Camelopardalis</i>, but she died a little before I came
to <i>Constantinople</i>; however, I caused her Bones,
which had been buried in the Earth, to be digged
up, that I might inspect the Make of this Creature.
It is an Animal a great deal taller in the Forepart
than in the Hinder; and, for that Reason, it
is unfit to carry a Man, or any other Burden. It
hath an Head and a Neck like a <i>Camel</i>, but a
spotted Skin like a <i>Leopard</i>, and therefore it is called
by a Name derived from both, (<i>i. e.</i>) <i>Camelopardalis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> might have been imputed as a Piece of great
Neglect in me, not to have visited the <i>Euxine</i>,
especially as I had an Opportunity of sailing thither;
seeing the Ancients used to account it as
great a Piece of Curiosity to see <i>Pontus</i>, as to visit
<i>Corinth</i>. Thither, therefore, I sailed with a prosperous
Gale, and had the Privilege to be admitted
into some of the Pleasure-Houses of the <i>Grand
Seignior</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Valves of one of them, I beheld the
famous Fight of <i>Selimus</i> with <i>Ishmael</i> King of the
<i>Persians</i>, excellently described in Checker-Work.
I had also the View of many of the Orchards and
Groves of the <i>Turkish</i> Emperor, which were seated
in most pleasant Vallies. This I may say of them,
That they ow’d little to Art, but almost all to
Nature; so that I could not chuse but entertain
such <i>Epiphonema’s</i> as these in my Thoughts, O
most pleasant Houses for Nymphs! O choise Seats
for the Muses! O Retirements fit for the Learned!
To deal plainly with you (as I told you before)
they seemed to me, as it were, sensibly to bewail
their present Posture, and to cry aloud to <i>Christians</i>
for their better Cultivation; and not they only,
but much more <i>Constantinople</i> itself, yea, and all
<i>Greece</i> too; which being, heretofore, the most
flourishing Country in the World, is now wofully
enslaved by <i>Barbarians</i>. Formerly it was the Mother
and Nurse of all good Arts and liberal Sciences,
but now, alas! it seems to call for that Culture
and Humanity which once it delivered down
to us; and, by Way of Requital, claims the Redemption
of our common Religion from that <i>Scythian
Barbarism</i> under which it groans; and call
it may long enough, for (with Grief may we speak
it) <i>Christian</i> Princes, now a-days, are otherwise
employed; so that the <i>Turks</i> do not more domineer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
over the poor <i>Greeks</i>, than Vices, such as Luxury,
Gluttony, Sloth, Lust, Pride, <i>&amp;c.</i> do over <i>Christians</i>,
which so clog, enervate, and depress our
Minds, that we can hardly look Heaven-ward, or
aspire to any Thing that is truly Great and Excellent.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Methinks</span>, Duty and Piety should have been
sufficient Motives to us to help our afflicted Brethren;
but if we had been proof against those Incentives,
so that neither brave nor praise-worthy
Actions could unthaw our frozen Courage; yet
Profit and Advantage, which are now the great
Bias of the World, might have stirred us up to
recover such opulent and commodious Countries
from Infidels, and to possess them ourselves: But,
on the contrary, we plow the Ocean, even as
far as the <i>Indies</i>, and the very <i>Antipodes</i>, because
there we get rich Prey and Spoil at a cheap Rate,
even without Bloodshed, by imposing on the simple
and uncrafty <i>Indians</i>. ’Tis true, we pretend the
Conversion of the <i>Heathens</i>, but, if we go to the
Root of the Matter, (to our Shame be it spoken)
’tis their Gold, not their Godliness, is the Gain
we seek for. Our Ancestors carried it at quite another
Rate, who did not, like trading Merchants,
seek after those Places where there was most
Wealth, but where there was greater Opportunity
for noble and virtuous Atchievements; so that it
was not Profit, but Honour, which put them upon
hazardous and remote Expeditions: And when
they came home, they were more laden with Glory
than with Plunder. I speak this in your Ear;
for others, perhaps, may think it a peculiar thing
in me, to detract from the Manners of the present
Age. But, let them think what they will, I see
that the Arrow is drawn to the Head to destroy us;
and I am afraid, that we, who would not fight for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
Glory, shall be forced to do it to save our Lives.
But to return to <i>Pontus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> call the <i>Euxine</i>, <i>Caradenis</i>, (i. e.)
<i>The Black Sea</i>. It falls down thro’ narrow Streights
into the <i>Thracian Bosphorus</i>, where its Waters are
tossed up and down by many Vortices, Turnings,
and Windings, occasioned by several Promontories
jutting out into it; and thus, in one Day’s Passage,
it descends to <i>Constantinople</i>, and from thence,
almost by the like strait Passage, it breaks out into
the <i>Propontis</i>. In the Middle of the Bay, where
it makes its Influx into the <i>Bosphorus</i>, there is a
Rock with an erected Pillar, in the Basis whereof
is writ the Name of a certain <i>Roman</i>, called
<i>Octavian</i>, (if my Memory fail not) in <i>Latin</i>
Letters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the <i>European</i> Shore there is a Tower, called
<i>Pharos</i>, where they hang out Lights in the
Night, to guide Sailors by. Not far from this
Place, a River falls into the Sea, in the Channel
whereof there are found Stones, little inferior to
<i>Onyxes</i> or <i>Sardonyxes</i>, and, if they be polished,
are as shining as they. A few Miles from that
Bay, which I lately spoke of, we may see those
Streights over which <i>Darius</i> wasted his Army against
the <i>European Scythians</i>: And about the Middle,
between the two Mouths of the <i>Bosphorus</i>, there
are two Castles, one of which is in <i>Europe</i>, and
the other on the opposite Shore, in <i>Asia</i>. This
latter was possessed by the <i>Turks</i> long before <i>Mahomet</i>
took <i>Constantinople</i>. The other was built by
him some few Years after he became Master of
that City. The <i>Turks</i> make use of it, at this
Day, as a Prison for the nobler Sort of their Captives.
<i>Lazarus</i>, a Commander, or Prince of the
<i>Epitots</i> not long ago was taken Prisoner by the
<i>Turks</i>, together with some <i>Spaniards</i> at <i>Castlenovo</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
and committed to this Tower; from whence making
his Escape, and being retaken, he was impal’d,
(<i>i. e.</i>) put to a most cruel Death, by having
a Pole thrust thro’ his Body, from his Fundament to
his very Neck; yet he indured it with incredible
Patience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> you expect that I should here give
you an Account of those floating Islands, called
<i>Cyaneæ</i> or <i>Symplegades</i>. But, to deal freely with
you, those few Hours that I spent on the <i>Pontus</i>,
I saw no such Islands at all; whether they had
been carried to any other Place, I know not: If
you desire to have a more particular Information
concerning them, you may consult <i>Peter Gyllius</i>,
who was an exact Enquirer into such Curiosities;
for my Part, I shall record only what I saw, or
know to be true. Yet I think it is not fit for me
to conceal a Mistake that <i>Polybius</i> is guilty of; for
he proposes many Arguments, to prove that, in
Tract of Time, the <i>Euxine</i> will be choaked up with
Sand and other Trash, brought in by the <i>Danow</i>,
the <i>Borysthenes</i>, and other great Rivers falling into
it, that it would be made unfit for Navigation;
whereas, the contrary appeared to me; for that
Sea is every jot as navigable, at this Day, as it
was of old in the Days of <i>Polybius</i>. And though
he seemed to have some Grounds for his Opinion,
that to him were irrefragable, yet Time hath
shewed them to be weak. The like Observation
holds in other Cases; for, of old, who would not
believe the Ancients, who affirmed, upon seemingly
imaginable Grounds, That the Torrid Zone
was inhabitable? whereas, later Discoveries have
fully convinced us, That those hot Countries are
as well inhabited as any other Part of the Terrestial
Globe; nay, when the Sun is at the highest
with them, and darts down its Rays perpendicularly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
upon them; even at that very Time the
Ardency of the Heat is so tempered and cooled
by continued Rains, that those Countries are rendered
very fit for human Habitations. But to return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the <i>Grand Seignior</i> was informed, by
Letters, of my Arrival (as I said before) he sent to
the Governor of <i>Constantinople</i>, intimating his Pleasure,
that he should send us to him into <i>Asia</i>, as
far as the City of <i>Amasia</i>, or (as it is writ on ancient
Coins) <i>Amazeia</i>, where he then was. Upon
this Advice we prepared all Things for our Journey;
and, with our Guides, on the 9th of <i>March</i>
we were wafted over into <i>Natolia</i>, (for so the <i>Turks</i>
call <i>Asia</i> at this Day.) That Day we went no
farther than <i>Scutari</i>, a Town on the <i>Asiatick</i>
Shore, opposite to Old <i>Byzantium</i>; where, or very
little above it, the noble City of <i>Chalcedon</i> was formerly
thought to stand. The <i>Turks</i> were of Opinion,
That when our Horses, Coaches, Baggage,
and Train, together with ourselves, were all got
over the <i>Hellespont</i>, ’twas enough for one Day’s
Journey; especially considering, that if we had
forgot any of the necessary Accoutrements for our
Journey, or had left them behind at <i>Constantinople</i>,
(as it sometimes happened) we might bethink
ourselves before we went any farther, and
fetch them over. The next Day we continued our
Journey from <i>Scutari</i>, over fragrant Fields, full
of odoriferous Plants, and especially <i>Stæchas’s</i>, a
sweet smelling Spike. There we saw a vast Number
of <i>Tortoises</i>, stalking over all the Field, without
any Fear at all. We had certainly seized upon
a great many of them, as a Prey grateful to
our Palates, had it not been for our <i>Turkish</i> Guides,
whom we were afraid to disoblige; for if they had
seen any of them brought to our Table, much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
more, if they had touched them, they would
have thought themselves so defiled, that I know
not how many Washings would not have cleansed
their imagined Pollution. For, as I told you before,
the <i>Turks</i>, and the <i>Greeks</i> too, are so superstitious,
that they abhor ever to touch of that Animal;
so that, it being no hurtful Creature, and no
body endeavouring to catch them, the whole
Country abounds with <i>Tortoises</i>. I kept one of
them by me a great while, which had two Heads,
and it would have lived much longer, if I had
been as careful of it as I might. That Day’s
Journey brought us to a Village, called <i>Cartaly</i>,
which I mention, because I shall, for the future,
gratify you with the Knowledge of the several
Stages of this Voyage. For tho’ the Journey from
<i>Vienna</i> to <i>Constantinople</i> hath been performed by
many, yet this from <i>Constantinople</i> to <i>Amasia</i>,
hath, as yet, been undergone by no <i>Christian</i> that
I know of. From <i>Cartaly</i> we came to <i>Gabise</i>, a
Town of <i>Bithynia</i>, which some think was anciently
called <i>Libyssa</i>, and is famous for the Sepulchre
of <i>Hannibal</i>, who was there interred. From
thence there is a most pleasant Prospect into the
Sea, and into the Bay of <i>Nicomedia</i>; here also
grow <i>Cyprus</i> Trees of a wonderful Bulk and Tallness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> fourth Day’s Journey from <i>Constantinople</i>
brought us to <i>Nicomedia</i>, a City, anciently of great
Note; but we saw nothing remarkable in it, but
the Ruins and Rubbish of old Walls, with some
broken Pieces of Pillars with their Chapiters, which
were all the Remainders of its ancient Splendor, except
one Castle on an Hill, which was somewhat
more entire. A little before we came to this
Place, some Workmen, that were digging under
Ground, discovered a long Wall made with Marble,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
which (it may be) was part of the ancient Palace
of the Kings of <i>Bithynia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>Nicomedia</i>, we passed over a Cliff or
Ridge of Mount <i>Olympus</i>, and came to a Village
called <i>Kasockly</i>, and from thence to <i>Nice</i>; but it
was so late before we came thither, that the first
Watch was set. Not far from that Place, I heard
a mighty Noise, as if it had been of Men that
jeer’d and mock’d us. I asked what was the Matter?
Whether any of the Mariners, rowing on the
Lake <i>Ascanius</i>, (which was not far off) did deride
us, for travelling at that unusual Time of Night?
I was answered, No, but it was only the howling
of certain Beasts, which the <i>Turks</i> call <i>Ciacals</i>, or
<i>Jacals</i>. They are a Sort of Wolves, somewhat
bigger than Foxes, but less than common Wolves;
yet as greedy and devouring as the most ravenous
Wolves or Foxes of all. They go in Flocks, and
seldom or never hurt either Man or Beast, but get
their Food by Craft and Stealth, more than by open
Force. Thence it is, that the <i>Turks</i> call
subtle and crafty Persons, especially the <i>Asiaticks</i>,
by the Metaphorical Name of <i>Ciacals</i>. Their
Manner is to enter into the Tents or Houses of the
<i>Turks</i>, in the Night-Time, and what they can
catch that is eatable, that they eat; and if they
find nothing else to devour, then they fall a
gnawing of all Kinds of Leather Things, as
Shoes, Boots, Girdles, Scabbards of Swords, and
the like; and they are as cunning as they are
thievish; but in this they are very ridiculous, that
they discover themselves by the Noise they make.
For whilst they are most busy in a House, devouring
their Prey, if any one of their Herd, that
stays without Doors, chance to howl, they all set
up a howling likewise; and thus, forgetting where
they are, they raise up the People of the House,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
who leap out of their Beds, and cudgel them
soundly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the next Day we staid at <i>Nice</i>; I believe
my Lodging was in the same House where the
Council of <i>Nice</i> was heretofore celebrated. As for
the Town itself, it is seated on the Bank of the
Lake <i>Ascanius</i>. The Walls of it are almost entire,
so are the Gates, which are but four, and
may all may be seen from the Middle of the
Market-Place; in each of them there were old
Inscriptions in <i>Latin</i>, which shew that the
Town was repaired by <i>Antoninus</i>: which of them
I do not well remember; but sure it must be by
<i>Antoninus</i> the Emperor. There are also some
Remainders of his Baths, and whilst the <i>Turks</i>
were digging out Stones from thence to build
Houses at <i>Constantinople</i>, they found the Statue of
a Soldier in his Armour, curiously wrought, and
almost entire; but they quickly battered it with
their Hammers, even in our View; and when we
shewed ourselves displeased at their rude Violence,
they paid us with a Jeer, <i>What</i>, said the Labourers,
<i>will you bow down to worship this Statue, as you
<span class="antiqua">Christians</span> used to do to yours?</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>Nice</i> we continued our Journey to a
Place called <i>Jenysar</i>. From <i>Jenysar</i> to <i>Ackbyuck</i>,
from <i>Ackbyuck</i> to <i>Bazargyck</i>, from <i>Bazargyck</i> to
<i>Bosowick</i>, otherwise called <i>Cassumbasa</i>, seated in
the narrowest Streights of Mount <i>Olympus</i>; for almost
all our Way from <i>Nice</i> thither, lay through
the Cliff of that Mountain. At <i>Nice</i> we lodged
in a <i>Turkish</i> Inn, or Hospital, and just against it
was a Rock, standing on high Ground, wherein
there was a square deep Trench cut, and from the
Bottom thereof there issued out a Canal, that
reached to the Highway. That Trench or Ditch,
the ancient Inhabitants of that Place used, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Winter Time, to fill with Snow; that so the
melted Snow-Water gently dropping down into
the Road, by the fore-mentioned Canal, might
quench the Thirst of parched Travellers. Such
Works as these the <i>Turks</i> count <i>Eleemosynary</i> ones;
because they are for the publick Benefit and Advantage
of Mankind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> far from this Place, on the Right Hand,
we saw a Town, called <i>Otmanlick</i>, borrowing
its Name, (as I conceive) from <i>Ottoman</i>,
the Founder of the <i>Ottoman</i> Family, who lived
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> those Streights we descended into an open
Campaign; and when we came thither, we lay
the first Night in our Tents, whereby the Heat
did not so much incommode us, as otherwise it
would have done; the Place was called <i>Chiausada</i>.
The most remarkable Things we saw here, was a
subterraneous House, that had no Light, but only
what stole in at the Roof: We saw also that Sort
of <i>Goats</i>, of whose Hair, (or Fleece, if you had
rather call it so) they make the Shagreen or watered
Stuff, called Camlet. If you would know the
Nature of that Creature, I shall not entertain you
with a Flam, but give you the true Description
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hair of this Creature is very fine, and extreamly
white, and it hangs down from their Bodies
to the Ground. The Goat-herds do not
sheer, but kemb it off, and it is almost as fine as
Silk. These <i>Goats</i> are often washed in the neighbouring
Rivers, and feed upon the Grass growing
there, which is very tender and dry, and that
certainly contributes much to the Fineness of their
Wool; for if they are removed to another Place,
their Fleece changes with their Pasture, and their
Kids do so degenerate, that one would hardly think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
them of the same Breed. The Thread that is
spun of that Hair or Wool, is carried, by the Women
of that Country, to <i>Ancyra</i>, a City of <i>Galatia</i>,
where it is woven into Cloth and dy’d, as
I shall tell you anon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span> the Sheep of those Countries have
very fat and weighty Tails, (their Sheep-Flocks
consist hardly of any other.) The Tail of any one
of them weighs sometimes three or four Pound,
and sometimes eight or ten; yea, they grow so
big in some old Sheep, that they are forc’d to lay
them upon a Plank, running on two little Wheels,
that so they may draw them after them, not being
otherwise able to trail them along.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> you will think I tell you a Romance;
but, take it on my Word, it is a certain Truth.
I grant, such bulky Tails may be of some Advantage,
because they are full of Fat; but the
Flesh of the Sheep seemed more harsh and rank
to me, than our own Mutton. The Shepherds
that tend them lie Day and Night in the Fields,
and carry their Wives and Children about with
them, in Waggons, which serve them instead of
Houses; only sometimes they erect small Tents
to lie under. They wander far and near, sometimes
in the open Campaign, sometimes over Hills,
sometimes over Dales, as the Season of the
Year, and the Necessity of Pasturage, doth require.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> saw also in those Countries, some Sort of
Birds, unknown to us, and such as I never saw
before. Among the rest, there is a Kind of <i>Ducks</i>,
which gives a Sound like Trumpeters, or such as
blow the Cornet; the Noise they make is almost
like the Sound of a Post-Boy’s Horn. It is a Bird,
which though it hath nothing wherewith to defend
itself, yet is very strong and daring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> are verily persuaded, that the Devils
are afraid of these Birds. This is certain, they
are so tenaciously sensible of their Liberty, that tho’
they have been kept up tame in a Coop, for three
Years together, yet if they can but get an Opportunity
to escape away, they fly to their wonted
Haunts, as preferring their natural Seats before their
confined Prisons, though they be cramm’d and
fatten’d there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> passed on from <i>Chiousada</i> to <i>Karali</i>; from
<i>Karali</i> to <i>Hazdengri</i>; from thence to <i>Mazotthoy</i>;
from <i>Mazotthoy</i> we passed over the River <i>Sangar</i>,
which runs into <i>Pontus</i> out of <i>Phrygia</i>, and came
to <i>Mahathli</i>, from thence to <i>Zugli</i>, thence to
<i>Chilancyck</i>; from <i>Chilancyck</i> to <i>Ialancich</i>; from
thence to <i>Portughin</i>; and from <i>Portughin</i> we
reached to <i>Ancyra</i>, called by the <i>Turks</i>, <i>Angur</i>.
We staid one whole Day at <i>Ancyra</i>, partly because
the <i>Turks</i> did not hasten us; for, in regard the
<i>Persian</i> Embassador made an Halt, we were desired
to do so too, that we might make our Entrances,
both at one Time, into <i>Amasia</i>. I saw
nothing remarkable in all the Villages aforementioned,
save that sometimes, among the <i>Turkish</i> Sepulchres,
we happened to see some Pillars, or ancient
Stones of curious Marble, wherein there were several
Remains of <i>Latin</i> or <i>Greek</i> Inscriptions, but so defaced,
that they could not be read; which Disappointment
I very much resented, for all my
Delight was, as soon as I came to my Inn at
Night, to enquire after old Inscriptions, together
with <i>Latin</i> and <i>Greek</i> Coins; and sometimes for
rare Kinds of Plants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the Sepulchres, or Graves of the <i>Turks</i>,
their Custom is, not to fill them with Earth, but
throw great Stones upon them for a Covering.
Would you know the Reason? ’tis Superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
enough. The <i>Turks</i> believe, that whenever the Devil
accuses the Deceased, and calls upon him to give
an Account how he spent his Life; then his good
Genius will defend him, and this Stone is the
Place upon which the Ghost must sit, that he may
plead his Cause with more Care; and it is so huge
and bulky, that Dogs, Wolves, or other ravenous
Beasts, especially the <i>Hyænæ</i>, may not injure his
Corps as it lies in the Earth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Hyæna</i> is a Beast common in these Countries;
she uses to dig up Graves, and taking out
the dead Bodies from thence, carries them to her
Den, near which you shall see a great Heap of
Bones of Men, Horses, and other Creatures. She
is a little lower than a Wolf, and quite as long; she
hath a Skin like a Wolf, only her Hair is rougher
and full of great black Spots; her Head is contiguous
to her <i>Spina dorsi</i>, without any <i>vertebræ</i> at
all; so that, when she looks backward, she must of
necessity turn her whole Body: Instead of a Row
of Teeth, she hath but one continued Bone. The
<i>Turks</i> do ascribe great Vertue to this Beast, in
<i>Philtres</i>, as did the Antients: there were two of
them at <i>Constantinople</i>, when I was there; I cheapned
them, but their Owners were unwilling to sell
them, because they kept them for the <i>Sultaness</i>,
who was thought, by Love-Portions, and Magic
Art, to have engaged her Husband’s Love to
her. Here I cannot chuse but take Notice of a
Mistake in <i>Bellonius</i>, who thinks the <i>Hyæna</i> to be
the same Creature with that we call the <i>Zibeth</i> or
<i>Musk-Cat</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> have a Tradition, that the <i>Hyæna</i>,
which they call <i>Zirtlan</i>, understands what Men say
one to another. The Antients affirm’d, that they
could also imitate Man’s Voice, and thereupon
Hunters catch them by this Wile. They find out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
her Den, which they may easily do by the heap of
Bones lying by it; and then one of them goes in
with a Rope, leaving the other End of the Rope
in the Hands of his Fellows without; and when
he is creeping in, he cries with a loud Voice, <i>Joctur,
Joctur, Ucala!</i> i. e. <i>She is not here, She is not here!</i>
or, <i>I cannot find her!</i> whereupon, the <i>Hyæna</i>,
thinking she is not discovered, lies close, and he ties
one end of the Rope about her Leg; and then he
goes forth, still crying, <i>I cannot find her!</i> but when
he is escaped quite out of the Hole, he cries out
aloud, <i>She is within, She is within!</i> which the <i>Hyæna</i>
hearing, and understanding the meaning of it,
leaps out, thinking to escape; but then they hold
her back by the Rope, tied to her Leg, and
either kill her, or, if they use Care and Diligence,
lake her alive, for she is a fierce Creature, and defends
herself desperately.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> found abundance of Old Coins all up and down
this Country, especially of the later Emperors, <i>viz.</i>
the <i>Constantines</i>, the <i>Constantius</i>’s, the <i>Justin</i>’s, the
<i>Valens</i>’s, the <i>Valentine</i>’s, the <i>Numerian</i>’s, the <i>Probus</i>’s,
the <i>Tacitus</i>’s, and such like. In many Places
the <i>Turks</i> use them for Weight, <i>viz.</i> of a Drachm,
or half a Drachm; and they call it <i>Giaur Manguri</i>,
i. e. the Money of the <i>Pagans</i> or <i>Infidels</i>. The
like Coins I found in the neighbouring Cities of
<i>Asia</i>, as at <i>Amysus</i>, at <i>Synopis</i>, at <i>Cumana</i>, at
<i>Amastris</i>, and <i>Amasia</i> itself, whither we were going.
There was a Brasier of that City which grieved me
very much; for demanding of him, whether he
had any Old Coins to sell? He answered me, That
a few Days ago, he had a large Room full of them,
but had melted them down to make Brass Kettles,
as thinking them of little Value, and fit for no
other Use. When I heard this Story, it troubled me
much to lose so many choice Monuments of Antiquity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
but I paid him back in his own Coin, by
telling; him, That I would have given him a hundred
Guilders for them; so that my Revenge was
suited to his Injury; for I sent him away as sorrowful,
as he did me for losing the Coins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for Plants, I saw very few in my Journey
in those Parts, which were unknown to us in <i>Europe</i>.
They were almost all of the same Kind; only they
were more or less flourishing, according to the Richness
or Poverty of the Soil. The <i>Amomum</i>, which,
<i>Dioscorides</i> says, grows near <i>Pontus</i>, I very diligently
sought for, but in vain; so that I knew not
whether that Plant did not fail in that Country, or
else was transplanted into another.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Town of <i>Ancyra</i>, was our 9th Stage
from <i>Constantinople</i>. It is a Town of <i>Galatia</i>,
sometimes the Seat of the <i>Gauls</i>, called by <i>Pliny</i>,
<i>Tectosagum</i>; nor was it unknown to <i>Strabo</i>: Though
perhaps the present Town is but part of the old
Town, called in the Canons, <i>Anguira</i>. Here we
saw a stately Superscription, and a Sampler of those
Tables, wherein the Atchievments of <i>Augustus</i>
were summarily comprehended. I caused as much
of it, as we could read, to be transcribed. It is
cut in the Marble Walls of that Structure, which
heretofore was the Town-hall; but is now demolished,
so that one part of it is visible to those that enter
on the right Hand, and the other to those that enter
upon the left. The top Chapiters are almost
entire; the Middle is full of Clefts, and the lowermost
Part of it is so battered with Clubs and Hatchets,
that it cannot be read; which Loss cannot be
sufficiently lamented by all Lovers of Learning; and
so much the more, because the Commons of
<i>Asia</i>, dedicated this City to <i>Augustus</i>. Here also,
we were Eye-witnesses of the dying of that Cloth,
I spake of before, made of Goats-wool, and how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
they Camlet it, or give it its Water-colour; ’tis
done thus. They pour Water upon it, and by
means of a Cloth-press, cause it to receive that Colour.
That is counted the best, which is most variegated
in every part; and if, in any Piece, the
Water-colours do not deeply and uniformly appear,
that Piece, though of the same Colour, and made
of the same Wool, is valued at some Gilders less
than another, because it is not so deeply tinctured.
The better sort of <i>Turks</i>, in their old Age, are
usually clothed with this Sort of Cloth, and <i>Solyman</i>
himself used to wear Vests of it; but Green is a
Colour disused much by <i>Christians</i>; and the rather,
because the <i>Turks</i> commend it upon a Superstituous
Account, as being worn by their Prophet <i>Mahomet</i>
in his older Days.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> black Colour is counted unfortunate, and is
disliked by them; and, when they see any Man so
clad, they look on it as an ill <i>Omen</i>; so that when
any of ours did approach the <i>Bashaw’s</i>, in a black
Habit, they look’d a-squint on us, and made sad
Complaints; and the Truth is, none of their own
appear in black, but either one that is desperately
poor, or else so overwhelm’d with some great Calamity,
that he regards not what Cloaths he wears.
A Purple Colour is a creditable Colour with them;
only it is an Omen of much Bloodshed in Time
of War: But the ordinary approved Colours among
them, are the <i>White</i>, the <i>Yellow</i>, the <i>Sea-Green</i>, the
<i>Violet-Colour</i>, and <i>Mouse-Colour</i>, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> ascribe very much to <i>Augury</i>, and
<i>Omens</i>, Good or Bad, so that it hath been known,
that some <i>Bashaws</i> have been removed from their
Places and Offices, by reason of a Fall from their
Horse; as if that were an <i>Omen</i> of some ill Luck,
which is averted from the Publick, by falling on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
the Head of that private and particular Person; who
is thereupon degraded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>Ancyra</i>, we came to a Village called
<i>Balygazar</i>, and from thence to <i>Zarekuct</i>; from
<i>Zarekuct</i> to <i>Zermeczii</i>, and to the Bank of the
River <i>Halys</i>: As we past through a Village called
<i>Algii</i>, we saw, at some Distance, the neighbouring
Mountains of <i>Synopi</i>, which were red, like Vermillion;
and from which Red Lead is called <i>Synopi</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> <i>Halys</i> is the famous River which was heretofore
the Boundary of the two Kingdoms of the
<i>Medes</i> and <i>Lydians</i>; concerning which, there was
an ancient Oracle, That when <i>Crœsus</i> pass’d it to
make War on the <i>Persians</i>, he should overthrow
a great Empire, which fell out to be his Own;
whereas he thought it would have been the <i>Persians</i>.
Near the Bank of this River, there was a
Wood, which seemed to us, to bear an unknown
Shrub; but when we drew near, we found it to be
<i>Liquorice</i>, and with the Juice of its Root, we refreshed
our selves abundantly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Near</span> that River, we met with a Countryman,
and asking him, by an Interpreter, Whether that
River did abound with Fish? And how they used
to catch them? He answered, That there were
Fishes enough; but no Body could catch them.
When he saw we wondred at his Answer, he proceeded:
For, <i>says he</i>, if a Man strive to take them
up in his Hands, away presently they swim, and
will not stay to be catched. This Answer was the
less surprizing to me, because, when we had lighted
upon some unknown Birds, and demanded of
the Country-men, <i>how we might take them?</i> One
or other of them told us, That they could not be
taken; for if any Body endeavoured to lay Hands
on them, they would fly away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> one of my Collegues, <i>Francis Hay</i>, having
some Nets with him, caused them to be cast for
the catching of Fish; we took a great Draught of
them, and especially the <i>Silurus</i>, or <i>Sheathfish</i>, which
are common in the <i>Danow</i>. Besides, there is in that
River, good Store of Sea-Crabs, or else, a Sort of
Fish very like them. Whereupon, the <i>Turks</i>, who
saw our Fishing, wondered at the Industry and
Ingenuity of <i>Christians</i>, who would catch Fish at
that Rate. Hereupon, perhaps, you will say, What,
are there no Fishermen in <i>Turkey</i>? I grant there
are; but very few of them live in those Parts.
And, I remember, in another Place, when the
<i>Turks</i> saw us turn the Stream out of its Course to
catch Gudgeons at the Bottom, they laughed much
at us. <i>What</i>, said they, <i>do you catch such small
guddling Fish? what are they good for?</i> This Ninny-Hammer
did not understand, that a great many of
those Fishes would make a dainty Dish, enough to
suffice many Guests. But the <i>Turks</i> are so parsimonious,
that they don’t study their Bellies at all;
give them but Bread and Garlic, or an Onion,
with a Sort of <i>Bonniclabber</i>, or sour Milk, known
in <i>Galen</i>’s Time, by the Name of <i>Syllabub</i>, but
called by them, <i>Ingurthe</i>; they feed like Farmers,
and desire nothing more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> make this Drink thus; they dilute this
Milk with cold Water, and then cram Bread into
it. This they use in the hottest Weather, and when
they are more athirst; and we our selves found
great Benefit by it, in our greatest Droughts. It is
a Repast very grateful to the Palate and Stomach,
and of admirable Vertue in quenching the most
vehement Thirst: There is abundance of it ready
made for Sale in all the <i>Turkish</i> Inns, or <i>Caravasera’s</i>,
as well as all other Sorts of Soop. As for
hot Meat, or Flesh, the <i>Turks</i> don’t much use<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
them in their Travels; their usual Dyet, on the
Road, are <i>Syllabubs</i>, <i>Cheese</i>, <i>dry’d Plumbs</i>, <i>Pears</i>,
<i>Peaches</i>, <i>Quinces</i>, <i>Figs</i>, <i>Raisins</i>, and <i>Cornel-berries</i>;
all these are exposed to sale in great earthen Platters
boiled in clean Water; every one takes what he
likes best. Those Fruits, with Bread, is his Food;
and the Water which remains, serves for Drink.
Thus their Meat and Drink stand them in very
little; so that I dare say, one <i>Christian</i> spends more
Money, on his Belly, in one Day, than a <i>Turk</i>
doth in twelve; yea, their most solemn Feasts consist
of <i>Wafers</i>, <i>Cakes</i>, and such-like Junkets, together
with several Dishes of <i>Rice</i>, with some <i>Mutton</i>,
and <i>Pullet</i>; for <i>Capons</i> are not yet known in
<i>Turkey</i>; but as for <i>Pheasants</i>, <i>Thrushes</i>, and Birds
called <i>Figeaters</i>, they never so much as heard of
their Names. But, if <i>Honey</i> and <i>Sugar</i> be mix’d
with the Water, the Drink is like <i>Jove’s Nectar</i> to
them. One Sort of their Liquors I had almost forgot,
’tis this. They take <i>Raisins of the Sun</i>, and
bruise, or grind them in a Mill, and then put them
into a wooden Vessel, pouring a certain Proportion
of hot Water upon them. This Mixture they stir
about a little, and then cover the Vessel close, and
suffer it to ferment a Day or two; if it works
well, then they add Lees of Wine to quicken the
Operation. When it first begins to ferment, if you
taste it, ’tis over-sweet, and that makes it more unpalatable;
but afterwards it acquires something of
an Acid Taste, which, mix’d with the Sweet, is
very grateful to the Palate for about three or four
Days; especially if it be mixed with Snow, of
which there is plenty at <i>Constantinople</i> at all times.
This Drink they call <i>Arabsorbet</i>, i. e. the <i>Arabian
Potion</i>. It will not keep long, but grows sour
in a very little Time. ’Twill fly up in your Head,
and make you reel as bad as any Wine, if you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
drink too much of it; and therefore, the <i>Turks</i>,
by the rules of their Religion, are forbidden to
drink it. For my Part, I liked it very well; yea,
that sort of Grapes was very acceptable and refreshing;
in many Places they keep them all Summer
long. The way of preserving them, they told
me, was this: They take large Bunches of Grapes
ston’d (as the hot Sun quickly ripens them in those
Countries); these they put into a Wooden or Earthen
Vessel, in the Bottom whereof, they first lay a
Line of groun’d Mustard-Seed; then they spread a
Line of Grapes upon it; thus with a Lay of Grapes,
and a Lay of grinded Mustard-Seed, they fill it up
to the Top; and, when the Vessel is full, then they
pour in new <i>Must</i>, as much as will fill all the Interstice;
then they shut it close, and so let it stand
till the hot Time of the next Year, when Men
stand most in need of Drink. Then these Vessels
are broach’d, and the Grapes, with its Liquor, are
set to sale. The <i>Turks</i> like the Liquor as well as
the Grapes; but I did not so well like the Taste of
the Mustard-Seed, and, therefore, I caused the
Grapes to be washed, and then, when I was most
thirsty, they gave me great Relief. I hope you
will give me leave to commend a Food to you,
that did me so much good, seeing the <i>Egyptians</i>
esteemed their Herbs and Plants, which were contributory
to their Health, as so many <i>Deities</i>. But
’tis Time for a Wanderer to return back into the
Way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the Bank of the River <i>Halys</i>, which the
<i>Turks</i> call <i>Aitoczu</i>, we came to <i>Gonkurthoy</i>; from
thence to <i>Choron</i>, and from thence to <i>Theke Thioi</i>,
where the <i>Turks</i> have a stately Monastry for their
<i>Priests</i> and <i>Monks</i>, called <i>Dervises</i>. Those <i>Dervises</i>
told us a great Story of a certain Man, called
<i>Chederles</i>, of an huge Stature, and graveness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
Mind answerable thereto. They suppose it was the
same with our St. <i>George</i>, and ascribe the same
Exploits to him; as the saving of a Virgin by the
Slaughter of a huge and terrible <i>Dragon</i>. To which
they add many Fables and Imaginations of idle
Brains; as that he travelled over several Countries
far and near, and at last came to a River, whose
Waters made those that drank them immortal;
but in what Part of the World this River is, they
cannot tell us; they say, moreover, that it lies
somewhere in a great Cloud, or Mist of Darkness,
and that never a Man saw it since <i>Chederles</i>. As
for <i>Chederles</i> himself, he was made Immortal, and
so was his Horse, by drinking the same Water,
who now, both do invisibly travel over the World,
delighting in Wars, and appearing therein to the
most Valiant, or to those who implore his Aid, of
what Religion soever they be: Such ridiculous
Fancies do they please themselves with! To which
we may add, other Things as absurd as those before-mentioned,
That he was one of the Friends
and Companions of <i>Alexander the Great</i>. For, the
Truth is, the <i>Turks</i> keep no just Account either of
Times or Ages, but makes a confused Hodge-podge
of all History. When they have a Mind to it, they
scruple not to say, <i>That <span class="antiqua">Job</span> was Master of the
Horse to King <span class="antiqua">Solomon</span>, and that <span class="antiqua">Alexander the
Great</span> was General of his Army</i>; with such-like
Stuff.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> that Monastry, or Mosque, there is a Fountain
that bubbles forth very clear and limpid Water; it is
built about and cover’d with most excellent Marble,
and they ridiculously would have People believe,
that it had its Original from <i>Chederles</i>’s Horses,
which he pissed in great Plenty in that Place.
They also told us many <i>Rodomontado</i>’s concerning
the Companions of <i>Chederles</i>, concerning his chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Groom, and also concerning his Nephew by his
Sister, all which were buried near at hand, and
their Sepulchres there to be seen; and when any
Suppliants come to pay their Devotions to them,
they would have persuaded us, that they receive
great Relief thereby; yea, they superstitiously affirm,
That the Fragments of the Stones, and the very
Earth itself, on which <i>Chederles</i>’s Feet stood, when
he staid for the Dragon, if drank in any Liquor,
are very good against Fevers, the Head-Ach, and
the Diseases of the Eyes. All the Country thereabout,
is full of Dragons and Vipers, so that, in
the hot Season of the Year, they are so thick,
basking themselves in the Sun, that the Ways are
almost unpassable for Travellers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> had almost forgot to tell you, that, whereas,
the <i>Greeks</i> do usually paint St. <i>George</i> on Horseback
in their Temples, with his Squire behind him,
holding out to him a Cup of Wine as to his Master,
he being (as they believe) their <i>Chederles</i>; they
laugh heartily at that Spectacle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this Place, we were near our Journey’s End,
for now we had but one Stage more to <i>Amasia</i>;
and that was <i>Baglison</i>; from thence we reached
<i>Amasia</i>, <i>April 7</i>, and thirty Days after, we left
<i>Constantinople</i>. As we were coming, some <i>Turks</i>
met us, to gratulate our Arrival, and to introduce
us with Honour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Amasia</i></span> is, in a manner, the chief City of
<i>Cappadocia</i>, where the <i>Turkish</i> Governor of that
Province usually had his Residence, for the Administration
of Justice, and where he usually forms
his Camp. But that Town, ever since <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Time, seemed to be very unlucky, and of late,
the miserable Case of <i>Mustapha</i> hath confirmed it
to be an unfortunate Seat. <i>Strabo</i> writes, that he
was born there. It lies on the Side of two opposite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
Hills, the River <i>Iris</i> dividing the City of the
midst, running between them; so that from each
Part you may look down upon the River, as
from the Seats or Stairs of a Theatre; and one
Side of it is conspicuous and open to the view of the
other. It is so encompassed with Hills, that there
is but one way to it, either for Coach or Waggon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> same Night we came thither, there happened
a great Fire, which the <i>Janizaries</i> quenched, as
their manner is, by plucking down the Houses
adjoining. Upon occasion of this Accident, give
me leave to inform you, that the <i>Turkish</i> Soldiers are
well-pleased when a Fire happens; for, whereas
they must be employed to quench it, and usually
do it by ruining the contiguous Houses, they
have thereby an opportunity to rifle and plunder
both; so that they themselves do oftentimes privily
set Houses on Fire, that so they may filch and
steal what they can out of them; as I remember
once, when I was at <i>Constantinople</i>, there were
frequent Conflagrations of Houses. ’Twas plain,
they could not happen casually, but must be set on
Fire a purpose, and yet the Authors could not be
found; but the Fault was commonly cast on some
<i>Persian</i> Spies that were in Town: At last, upon a
diligent Search, ’twas found that the Soldiers had
stirr’d up their Fellows, that were a Ship-board,
to do the Feat; that so, during the Fire, they might
enrich themselves with the Spoils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> an high Hill, that hangs over and commands
<i>Amasia</i>, there is a strong Castle, wherein
the <i>Turks</i> have a continual Garrison, either to curb
the <i>Asiaticks</i>, who are not very well pleased with
the <i>Ottoman</i> Yoke (as I shall shew anon) or else to
bridle the <i>Persian</i>, who many times make large Excursions
even as far as this Town, though at such a
vast distance from them. In this Hill there are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
some ancient Monuments, which, perhaps, were
the Sepulchres of the <i>Cappadocian</i> Kings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the Houses and Streets of <i>Amasia</i>, there is
little or no Beauty in them. Their Houses are built
of Loom, as they are in <i>Spain</i>, plain at top without
any Roof, and what covering they have is of Loom
or Clay too. They have some old piece of a Pillar,
Cylinder or Roller, which they turn up and down
to stop any Chink or Crevice, made either by Rain
or Wind. The Inhabitants, in former Times, lay
down to sleep in the open Air. As for Rains, they
are not great, nor frequent in those Parts; but if at
any time a Shower falls, the Loomy Droppings
from the Eaves, do wofully dirty the Cloths of those
that pass under them. I saw there a certain young
noble Person, living not far from me, at his Supper,
after the old <i>Roman</i> fashion, lying on a Bed. As
soon as I came to <i>Amasia</i>, we were introduced to
compliment the supreme Vizier <i>Achmet</i>, and the
rest of the <i>Bashaw</i>’s, for their Emperor was then
gone abroad; we treated with them a while concerning
the Contents of our Embassy; and because
they would not seem to prejudice us, they lent us a
favourable Ear; referring all, however, to the Will
and Pleasure of their Emperor. When he came
home, we were led into his Presence, for Audience;
but he entertain’d us (and the Reasons we
alledg’d in the Speech we made him, according to
the Command of my Master) with a sour and
frowning Look. He sate upon a low Throne, not
above a Foot from the Ground, but it was all
covered over with rich Tapestry, and with Cushions
exquisitely wrought. His Bow and Arrows
lay by his side, he himself (as I said) looked sternly
upon us; and yet there was a certain Majesty,
mix’d with Severity, in his Countenance. Each
of us, as we entred the Room, was led up towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
him by some of his Bed-chamber Officers,
who held us by the Arm, (for so they use to introduce
Ambassadors, ever since a certain <i>Croatian</i>,
desiring to speak with <i>Amurath</i>, and drawing near
to him so to do, slew him in revenge of the death
of his Master, <i>Mark</i> the <i>Despot</i> of <i>Servia</i>, who
was killed by the said <i>Amurath</i>): and afterwards,
as if we had kiss’d his Hand, we were led backward
to the opposite part of the Room; for the <i>Turks</i>
count it an unmannerly thing to turn any of their
Back-parts to their Prince. From thence I had
liberty to declare our Master’s Commands; but
they suited not with his lofty, imperious Spirit, who
thought that nothing ought to be denied him, for
they were daring and high; so that he, as disdaining
them, said nothing but <i>Giusel, Giusel!</i> (i. e.)
<i>Well, Well!</i> And so we were dismissed to our
Lodgings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> our Audience there was a very full Court,
for a great many Governors of Provinces were
there with their Presents; and, besides the Imperial
Horse, <i>Spahi’s</i>, <i>Janipagits</i> and <i>Ululags</i>, there
were also a great number of <i>Janizaries</i>. But, among
this vast number of Courtiers, there was not
so much as one more eminent for Birth and Parentage;
each one, by his Valour and adventurous Atchievements,
was the Carver out of his own Fortune.
Their Honour ariseth from their Preferments;
so that there is no dispute about Precedency,
but every Man’s Pre-eminces is according to the
Office which he bears. And those Offices are distributed
at the meer Will and Pleasure of the Prince,
who does not regard the empty Name of Nobility,
nor value a Rush the Favour of the Multitude, or
of any other particular Man; but, considering only
the Merits and Disposition of the Man, he rewards
him accordingly. And, by that means, Employments<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
are bestowed upon such Persons as are best
able to manage them; and every Man hath an opportunity
to be the Hammerer out of his own Honour
and Preferment. Those which at present are the
greatest Officers under their Emperor, were mostly
the Sons of Shepherds or Neatherds; and they are
so far from being ashamed of the Meanness of their
Original, that they glory therein among one another;
and account it more Praise-worthy to be the
Advancers of themselves, than if they had Honour
transmitted down to them from their Ancestors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> thus they argue, Virtue is not propagated
from our Parents, but is partly the Gift of God,
and partly acquired by good Discipline, and by our
own Labour and Industry; so that, as no Son hath
his Father’s Skill in Music, Arithmetic or Geometry,
derived to him from his Birth, so neither can
Fathers bequeath Virtue as an Inheritance to their
Children; for the Soul, say they, is not communicated
with the Father’s Seed (so that a Son must
necessarily be born alike qualified as his Father was)
but it is infus’d into his Body from the God of
Heaven. Thus in that Nation, Dignities, Honours,
Offices, <i>&amp;c.</i> are the Rewards of Virtue and
Merit; as on the other side, Dishonesty, Sloth, and
Idleness, are among them the most despicable things in
the whole World. And by this means they flourish,
bear sway, and enlarge the Bounds of their Empire
every day more and more. But we, <i>Christians</i>,
to our shame be it spoken, live at another manner
of rate; Virtue is little esteemed among us, but
Nobleness of Birth (forsooth) carries away all the Honour
and Preferment. But enough of this at present:
More may be spoken on this Argument hereafter;
and what I have now said about it, pray
keep it to your self, for other Men may not be able
to bear my Freedom herein.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> return, then, to my Subject; I shall now present
you with a surprizing Spectacle, even a multitude
of Persons with picket Turbants on their Heads,
made of pure white Linnen folded together in Plates;
their other Apparel was very costly, of several Sorts
and Colours, all most radiantly shining with Gold,
Silver, Purple, Silk, Velvet, <i>&amp;c.</i> I am not able
to describe the Gaudiness of the <i>Show</i>; in one
Word, ’twas the most glorious one I ever saw in
all my Life. And yet, in all this Splendor, there
was a great deal of Simplicity and Parsimony too.
Those who were of one Order had Cloathing all of
one sort; there were no foolish Hems, Lacings,
Fringes or Borders, as among us, which cost a
great deal of Money, and yet wear out in a day or
two. The Silk and Velvet Suits, which many of
them wore, though mightily embroidered, yet
cost not above a Ducat the making and embroidering.
They did as much admire to see the Fashion
of our Cloaths, as we did that of theirs. Their
Vests are very long, almost down to their Heels,
which is more graceful, and makes them seem taller
than they are; but our Apparel (forsooth) is so curtail’d
and short, that it hardly covers the Parts
which Nature would have to be concealed; on
which Account it is less decent. Besides, it seems
to take away some Inches from the Tallness of our
Stature, and look more <i>Dwarf-like</i>. And yet,
among so great a Multitude, I took notice of this
most laudable Circumstance; ’twas all <i>hush</i>; not so
much as a word spoken among them all, nor no
humming Noise, as among a tumultuous Multitude;
no justling one of another, but every particular
Man quietly kept his own Station. The Heads of
them, which they call <i>Aga’s</i>, had Seats to sit upon,
such as their <i>Serasquiers</i>, or <i>Generals</i>, their
<i>Brigadiers</i>, <i>Colonels</i> and <i>Captains</i>; but the Commonalty
stood on their Feet. Among the rest, I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
most admir’d the <i>Janizaries</i>; though there were
some Thousands of them, yet they stood at a distance
one from another; Stock-still, (as we say) as
if they had been Statues: So that I, who was at some
distance from them, thought verily they had been
so, till being advised to salute them, as the manner
is, I saw them all bow their Heads, by way of
Resalutation, unto me. When we passed from
this Shew, behold there was another pleasurable
one, which entertain’d us; and that was their
Horse-Guards, in their March to their Quarters.
They rode upon gallant stately Prancers, excellently
well trapped, equipped, and Shod. Thus we
were dismissed, but with little hopes of obtaining
what we came for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the 10th of <i>May</i>, the <i>Persian</i> Ambassador
came to <i>Amasia</i>, and brought with him rich and
gallant Presents, as many choice sorts of Hangings,
<i>Babylonian</i> Tents, curiously wrought within with
many sorts of Needle-work, gallant Horse-Trappings,
and Saddles, Scymiters made at <i>Damascus</i>,
whose Handles were studded with Jewels, and
Shields of curious Workmanship; but that which
exceeded them all, was the <i>Alcoran</i>, so they call
the Book containing the Rites and Ceremonies of
their Religion, which they fancy <i>Mahomet</i> compos’d
by Divine Inspiration, and which is accounted
the most noble Present of all. They quickly accorded
with him on Terms of Peace, so that it
concern’d us to be cautious, who were to find
greater obstruction in our Negotiations with them.
And, to assure us that the Peace was confirm’d betwixt
them, they omitted no manner of extraordinary
Respect to their Ambassador. For the manner
of the <i>Turks</i> is, (as I told you before,) to be excessive
on both Sides, either in bestowing Honour on
their Friends, or in heaping Reproaches on their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
Enemies. <i>Haly Basha</i>, Deputy to the <i>Grand Vizier</i>,
treated the <i>Persian</i> with a sumptuous Dinner,
which he made in his Garden, a Place far distant
from us, and separated also by the interposal of the
River, yet we could see the Manner of it well enough;
for, I told you, the Place was seated so
high on both sides of the Hill, that the Eye might
easily discover what was done on each side.
This <i>Haly</i> is a <i>Dalmatian</i> by Birth, a Man of much
Wit, and, which is strange in <i>Turkey</i>, very courteous
to Strangers. The Table, at which the
<i>Bashaw</i> and the <i>Persian</i> Embassador sate, was covered
over with a Canopy, and the Dishes were served
up after this manner. There were one hundred
Youths, which attended, like Waiters, all of them
alike habited. First of all, they entered one by one,
at a small distance from each other, till the Train
of them reached up to the Table where the Guests
were sitting. They had nothing at all in their
Hands, that so they might not be hindered in saluting
the Guests, which was done in this manner;
they laid their Hands on their Thighs, and bowed
their Heads downwards to the Ground; when this
Ceremony was perform’d, then he that stood next
the Kitchen, took a Dish and gave it to the next
Page immediately before him; he handed it to a
Third, and he to a Fourth, and so from one to
another till it came to him who stood next the
Table, and he delivered it to the Hands of the
Gentleman-Sewer, who plac’d it on the Table.
And thus one hundred Dishes, or more, were
serv’d up to the Table in excellent Order, without
any Noise at all; and, when that was done,
those Waiters, or Pages, saluted the Guests a second
time, and so returned in the same Order they
came in; only, of course, those that were last before
went out first, and those which were nearest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the Table brought up the Rear. Thus the second
Course was also serv’d up; so that the <i>Turks</i> are
great Admirers of Orders, even in the smallest
matters, which we <i>Christians</i> are apt to neglect,
even in things of greatest Moment. At some distant
from the Ambassador sate his Attendants with
some <i>Turks</i> of Quality with them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Peace</span> being thus made with the <i>Persians</i>, as I
told you before, yet we could get no good Terms
of them at all, only we obtain’d an half year’s
Truce, till I could send to my Master, and know
his Answer. I was sent to be <i>Leiger</i> Ambassador
there; but, in regard there was no Peace settl’d betwixt
both Empires, the <i>Bashaws</i> thought it adviseable
for me to return to my Master with Letters
from <i>Solyman</i> their Emperor; and I was to return
with an Answer from his Imperial Majesty, if he
thought fit. Hereupon I was again introduced into
<i>Solyman</i>’s Presence, and had two large embroider’d
Veils, reaching down to my Ancles, clap’d upon
me; they were so heavy, that I could hardly stand
under them. My Family also, that attended me,
were all clad with silk Garments of divers Colours;
in this Posture I stalked along, like <i>Agamemnon</i>,
or some such piece of Gravity, in a <i>Tragedy</i>;
and so I took my leave of their Emperor, having
first receiv’d Letters from him to my Master, seal’d
and wrap’d up in Cloth of Gold, and the chief
of my Attendants were also admitted to take their
Leaves; and thus, after we had taken our leaves of
the <i>Bashaws</i>, I and my Collegues departed from
<i>Amasia</i>, <i>June</i> the 2d. The Custom is, that Ambassadors
at their Departure, have a Dinner provided
for them in the <i>Divan</i>, (so they call the
place where the <i>Bashaws</i> sit to administer Justice,)
but this is done only to their Friends; that Compliment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
was omitted to me, because Affairs were
not yet in an amicable Posture between them
and us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you ask me, what manner of Man <i>Solyman</i>
was, I’ll tell you. He was an ancient Man, his
Countenance, and the Mien of his Body, were very
majestick, well becoming the Dignity which he
bore; he was frugal and temperate, even from his
Youth, though he might have taken a greater Liberty
to himself by the Rules of their own Religion. In
his younger Days he was not given to Wine, nor
to masculine Venery, which the <i>Turks</i> much delight
in; to that his very Enemies could object nothing
against him on those Accounts, but that he
was too uxurious, and his over-indulgence to his
Wife made him give way to the Death of his Son
<i>Mustapha</i>: Yet that Crime was vulgarly imputed
to an Ascendent she had over him, by reason of
her Inchantments and Love-Portions. This is
certain, that, after he once took her for his lawful
Wife, he never had carnal Knowledge of any other
Woman, though their Laws did not forbid him. He
is a very strict Observer of the <i>Mahumetan</i> Religion,
and is as desirous to propagate that, as to enlarge
the Bounds of his Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> is now sixty years of Age; and, for a Man
of his Years, he enjoys a moderate proportion of
Health, and yet his Countenance doth discover,
that he carries about him some hidden Disease, ’tis
thought a Gangrene, or Ulcer, in the Thigh;
yet at solemn Audiences of Ambassadors, he hath a
<i>Fucus</i> to paint his Cheeks with, that he may appear
sound and healthy to them, and thereupon be more
dreaded by foreign Princes, their Masters. Methought,
I discovered some such thing at my Dismission;
for his Countenance was as sour when I
left him, as it was at my first Audience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> thus taken my leave, I began my Journey
in the Month of <i>June</i>, and the Heat thereof
was so excessive, that it cast me into a Fever. ’Tis
true, it was a remiss and gentle one, yet it came
every Day; to which was added an Hoarseness, and
Defluction of Rheum from the Head, and it held
me till I came to <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Persian</i> Embassador left <i>Amasia</i> the self-same
Day that I did, and we went both out of the City
the same way; for, (as I told you before) there is
but one Passage into, or out of, that Town, it is so
shut in by the circumjacent and unpassable Hills:
But the Way quickly doth divide into two, one
to the <i>East</i>, which the <i>Persians</i> took; and another
to the <i>West</i>. which was our Road. In the open
Fields about the Town, we saw the <i>Turkish</i> Camp
pitch’d, with abundance of Tents. I shall not entertain
you with the Stages of my Return, they
being the same with those of my Journey thither,
only we made a little more Speed, and sometimes
rode two Day’s Journey in one. In fine, we came
to <i>Constantinople</i>, <i>June</i> the 2d. You must needs
think I had a troublesome Journey of it, having
such a Companion with me, as a <i>Quotidian Ague</i>,
all the way; so that, when I came thither, I was
almost nothing but Skin and Bone: Yet, lean as
I was, when I came to rest, and by the advice of
<i>Quaquelben</i>, my Physician, used warm Baths,
I quickly recovered. One thing I observed in the
method of my Cure, that, when I came out of the
warm Bath, he would sprinkle me over with cold
Water, which, though it were troublesome to me at
the present, yet I found that it did me much good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> I staid at <i>Constantinople</i>, there was a
certain Person, that came from the <i>Turkish</i> Camp in
<i>Asia</i>, who told me a Story, which I shall acquaint
you with, because it shows that the <i>Asiaticks</i> are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
not very well pleased, either with the Religion, or
the Government of the <i>Turks</i>. ’Twas this: <i>Solyman</i>,
says he, as he was returning home, was
forc’d to lodge one Night in the House of a certain
<i>Asiatick</i>, and when he went away in the
Morning, his Host brought a great deal of Perfume,
and us’d a great many Ceremonies, to
cleanse and purge his House, as if it had been polluted
by such a Guest as <i>Solyman</i>; when <i>Solyman</i>
heard of it, he caused the Man to be slain, and his
House to be levelled with the Ground. This Punishment
the poor Man underwent for his Aversion
to the <i>Turks</i>, and his Propensity to favour the
<i>Persians</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> staid about fourteen Days at <i>Constantinople</i> to
refresh my self, and then I entred on my Journey
back again to <i>Vienna</i>: But I was entertain’d with
an inauspicious Omen, even a very sad Spectacle;
just as I was gone out of the Gates of <i>Constantinople</i>,
I met whole Waggon-Loads of Boys and
Girls, which were brought out of <i>Hungary</i> to
<i>Constantinople</i> to be sold; no Merchandize is more
frequent amongst them than that. For, as when
we leave <i>Antwerp</i>, we meet with all sorts of merchantable
Commodities importing into the Town, so
here, ever now and then, there passed by us abundance
of poor miserable <i>Christian</i> Slaves, which were going
to be sold in the Markets to a perpetual Bondage.
There was no distinction of Age; Old and
Young were driven in Herds, or Companies, or
else were tied in a long Chain, as we use to tail
Horses when we carry them to Fairs. When I beheld
this woful sight, I could not forbear weeping
and bemoaning the unhappy State of poor <i>Christendom</i>.
And if that miserable Spectacle were not afflicting
enough to a new Traveller, take another
bad and mortifying Occurrence: My Collegues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
had recommended some of their Retinue to me,
which were weary of living in <i>Turkey</i>, that they
might be of my Train, in returning to their own
Country. I granted their Request, and having travelled
two Day’s Journey, I perceiv’d one that was
Chief among them, (called a <i>Vaivode</i>, from his
Office,) was carried sick in a Coach; one of his
Feet being bare, without any Stockings, he would
not suffer it to be covered, for he had in it a
Plague-sore, which he found more easy to keep
open. We were much troubled at this sight, as
fearing that infectious Disease would spread farther;
but the poor Man liv’d till we came to <i>Adrianople</i>,
and there departed this Life. Upon his Death
another Mischief did succeed; as soon as the Breath
was out of his Body, the rest of the <i>Hungarians</i> ran
in greedily to the Prey, one caught up his Stockings,
another his Doublet, a third his Shirt, a fourth his
other Linnen; thus casting themselves, and us too,
into a great deal of Danger. Nor was there any
way in the World to hinder them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> true, my Physician, like an honest Man,
ran in amongst them, and intreated them, for
God’s sake, to throw the Things away, because they
would infect us all; but they were deaf to his
Advice. The Day after we left <i>Adrianople</i>, those
very Persons came to him, and complain’d
of a Pain in their Heads, with a dejection of their
Spirits, and a Listlessness both of Body and Mind,
and desired his Advice; he, suspecting the Symptoms
of the Plague in the case, told them, they were
well enough serv’d, for not harkening to his Counsel;
yet he would do them what good he could,
only, being on his Journey, he was unprovided of
proper Medicines. The same Day I walked abroad
into the Field, as I us’d to do, as soon as ever I
came to my Inn, to see if I could find any thing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
worthy of my Notice in those Countries, where
I met with an unknown Herb in the Meadow,
which smelt like <i>Garlick</i>. After I had pluck’d
some Leaves of it, I gave them to my Physician
to know his Judgment; he looked wistly upon it,
and told me, ’twas <i>Scordium</i>, and lifting up his
Hands to Heaven, he gave God thanks for sending
us so opportune a Remedy against the Plague; hereupon
he gathers a great quantity of it, and putting
it into a large Pot, boiled it over the Fire. Then
he bid the <i>Hungarians</i> take heart, and parted the
Decoction amongst them, prescribing the taking
of it very hot, as they were going to Bed, mix’d
with some <i>Lemnian</i> Earth, and <i>Diascordium</i>, and
that they should not sleep till they had fallen into a
great Sweat. Observing his Directions, the next
Day after they were much better, and desired the
same Portion again, and when they had drunk it,
they grew perfectly well. And thus, by God’s
Blessing, we avoided that Infection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> yet, the residue of our Journey was not
without Peril. After we had passed the Country
of the <i>Thracians</i> and <i>Bulgarians</i>, which reaches
as far as <i>Nissa</i>, and came into the <i>Servians</i> Country,
reaching from <i>Nissa</i> to <i>Simandria</i>, where the
<i>Rascians</i> Country begins; we came at last to <i>Belgrade</i>,
the Weather being excessively hot and
parching, for ’twas the hottest time of the <i>Dog-days</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> <i>Belgrade</i>, upon one of our Fish-days, we
were presented with abundance of choice Fish,
and amongst the rest, with large full-bodied <i>Carps</i>,
taken in the <i>Danube</i>, whose <i>Carps</i> are very much
commended: My People did eat very greedily of
them, and that was either the cause, or the occasion,
which cast many of them into a Fever; yet all that
quantity of Fish, which was enough to satisfy forty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
Men, cost but half a Dollar; and the Truth is,
other Things are as cheap. As for Hay, ’tis little
or nothing worth; the Meadows are so laden with
it, that every Man may take what he will, provided
he pay for the Mowing and Carriage; which
made us admire the Wisdom of the old <i>Hungarians</i>,
after they had passed the <i>Save</i>, who chose so
fertile a Country, as <i>Hungary</i>, to dwell in; where
there were all manner of Conveniences for Human
Life. We passed over a great Tract of Land, both
beyond and on this side the <i>Save</i>, and we found the
Grass, Barley, Oats and Wheat, almost parch’d
and withered with Drought; but as soon as we entred <i>Hungary</i>,
the Grass was so tall, that a Coach,
that went before, could hardly be seen by another
that came after; which is a great Argument of the
goodness of the Soil.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Rascians</i>, as I told you before, begin at <i>Simandria</i>,
and reach as far as the River <i>Drave</i>; they
are reputed to be a fudling sort of People, and not
very faithful to Strangers. Whence they had their
Name and Original, I do not certainly know; but
truly they were kind enough to us; we passed
through some Villages of theirs of less Note, and
at last arrived at <i>Esseck</i>, which is almost inclosed
with muddy Marshes, and is famous for the slaughter
of <i>Catzianerus</i>, and the overthrow of the <i>Christians</i>.
Here I was taken with a <i>Tertian Ague</i>, I
was so parch’d with Heat, in travelling the open
Fields of <i>Hungary</i>; and at <i>Esseck</i> we passed the
<i>Drave</i>, and came to <i>Lasque</i>, where being weary
with the Heat of my Journey, and my Ague, I
laid me down to Rest. There the chiefest of the
Place came to me to bid me welcome; and presented
me with large Melons, Pears, and Plumbs
of several Sorts, besides Wine, and other Provisions,
all of them very good; the noted Country of <i>Campania</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
in <i>Italy</i> hardly bears better. In the Room
where I lodged, there was a long Table all furnished
with these Viands: My Servants desired the
<i>Hungarians</i> to stay to Supper, excusing my Absence,
because of my Sickness. As soon as I awoke, and
saw such a full-spread Table before my Eyes, I
thought verily I had been in a Dream, and ask’d
my Physician, how that came about? He told me
plainly, that he himself had caused the Table to
be furnished, that so the very Sight of it might refresh
me. But must I not taste of it, said I? Yes,
said he, but you must only taste; and so I eat a
little of it, and seem’d to be much the better for it.
The Day after the <i>Hungarians</i> came to me again
to present their Service, desiring me to represent
their Condition to the Emperor, in regard of the
Wrongs they received from some of their Neighbours.
From thence we came to <i>Mohatz</i>, noted
for the Overthrow and Death of <i>Lewis</i> King of
<i>Hungary</i>; not far from that Town, I saw a River
whose Water was deep, and its Banks very steep; here
that unhappy Prince leapt in with his Horse, and was
drown’d, being for his Fall as much to be lamented,
as for his Imprudence, in venturing with a small and
newly rais’d Army of his Country-Men, to cope
with the more numerous, veteran, and well-disciplin’d
Forces of <i>Solyman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> <i>Mohatz</i>, we travelled on to <i>Tulna</i>, and
from thence to <i>Felduar</i>. There I passed over the
<i>Danube</i>, into an Island, pretty large, called <i>Cophis</i>,
inhabited by <i>Rascians</i>; and so repassing the <i>Danube</i>,
I arrived at <i>Buda</i> twelve Days after I left <i>Belgrade</i>,
<i>August</i> the 4th, having lost many of my
Horses by the way, who were choaked with eating
new Barley, and drinking over-cold Water. Besides,
I narrowly escaped Robbers, which these
Countries are much infested with, especially by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
those they call <i>Heydukes</i>, some of which were afterwards taken,
and put to death at <i>Buda</i>, where they
confessed to the <i>Bashaw</i> thereof, that they lay in wait
for me and my Train, under a broken Bridge we
were to pass, that so they might assault us unawares.
The Truth is, a few may very easily
circumvent and destroy a great many Passengers on
such Bridges; for the Bridges are ill-built, and the
Planks are set so wide, and gaping one from another,
that you can scarce go over them safe on Horseback,
without danger of falling, if you are never so
careful; and if some meet you before, others will
fall on your Rear, and others start out from the
Reeds and Sedges below, where they hide themselves,
and so accost you in the Flank, and you
can hardly manage your Horse for Self-defence, by
reason of the badness of the Bridge: No doubt you
may be treated as the <i>Romans</i> were in the <i>Caudine
Streights</i>; be either taken, or killed, at Pleasure.
I know not what it was that deterred them from
assaulting us; whether it were our Numbers, or
the Sight of the <i>Hungarians</i> with us; or because
we were in a long Train, and all were not on the
Bridge at once; or whatever else it was that withheld
them, by God’s Blessing, we got safe to <i>Buda</i>.
The <i>Bashaw</i> of the Town was not then at home;
he was gone to <i>Pest</i>, on the other side of the River,
where they had a Council of War, after the manner
of the <i>Hungarians</i>, they call them <i>Rachi</i>. Many
<i>Sanziacks</i> were already come thither, but more
were expected; for which Cause, when I desired
Audience, ’twas put off for three Days, that the
<i>Janizaries</i> and military Persons might make a
greater Show. Then I was sent for over, and conveyed
to his Tent, where he made Complaints to
me of the Injuries that some <i>Hungarians</i> had done
him. It is usual, in those frontier Garrisons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
both for <i>Hungarians</i> and <i>Turks</i>, mutually to complain
of one another; yea, sometimes they, that
are most in Fault, begin to complain first. The
<i>Turkish</i> Bashaw also added some threatning Expressions
of Revenge. It may be, he thought that the Sight
of his Army would terrify me; but he was mistaken.
I answered him roundly, that the <i>Hungarians</i>
might rather find Fault with the <i>Turks</i>, than
on the contrary; for I my self, in my Travels,
had seen some of his Soldiers plunder some <i>Hungarians</i>,
Subjects of his Imperial Majesty, and carry
away their Goods. He answered me, he had indeed
put some contumacious <i>Christians</i> under military
Execution; but they were such as were under
his Master, not the Emperor. Thus, after a mutual
Altercation, I was dismissed, being in very bad
plight, for my Ague-Fit was strong upon me all that
Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Day after, I went to <i>Gran</i>, having a
<i>Turkish</i> Guard of Horse along with me. I had a
mind to be wafted over the <i>Danube</i>, and for one
Night to lodge in a Village over against the Castle
of <i>Gran</i>, that the Day after I might come the
sooner to <i>Commara</i>, and be better able to endure
my Ague-Fit, which I expected that Day; and
therefore I entreated that Favour of my Guide,
that he would send some body over, to bring the
Ferry-Boat, that was on the other Side, that so our
Passage might be the easier. I found some Difficulty
in having my Request granted; yet, partly
to gratify me, and partly to acquaint the <i>Sanziacks</i>
with my Arrival there, he sent over two Persons.
When they were gone an Hour before, they spied
four Horsemen standing under a Tree, a little from
the High-way-side. They judged them, by their
Habits, to be <i>Turks</i>, and therefore turned aside to
accost them; and, as they drew near, they ask’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
them, What News? They answered not a Word;
but made at them with their drawn Swords, and
gave one of them such a Blow, athwart his Face,
that he made the greatest Part of his Nose to hang
down over his Chin; and then catching at his
Horse, which he held by the Bridle, he left his own
Beast, and mounting it, set Spurs, and away.
The <i>Turks</i> presently came back to us, especially
he with the maim’d Face, and, with a woful Lamentation,
bid us prepare for the Combat, for we
were Way-laid. I, to encourage my Men, got
presently on Horse-back; but we came too late,
when the Scuffle was over; for they had more
mind to preserve the Prey they had got, than to
fight; and thereupon fled speedily to <i>Javarin</i>, a
Garrison of ours, to which they did belong: The
<i>Turks</i> shewed them to us, as they were scouring over
the neighbouring Hills that led to <i>Javarin</i>. Thus
we came to <i>Gran</i>; the <i>Sanziack</i> very friendly gave
me a Visit, and, among other Discourse, he put me
in mind of the Insolency of the <i>Hungarian</i> Soldiers,
who could not be kept from Thieving (said he)
though you, the Emperor’s Ambassador, were in
company of those they robbed; and therefore he
desired of me, that the Horse they took away
yesterday might be restored. In the mean Time,
the <i>Turk</i>, that was wounded the Day before, stood
without in the Entry, with his Nose sewed together,
through which he made a lamentable Moan,
desiring me to pity his Condition. I told him, I
would give him what was enough for his Cure, and
so I bestowed two Duckets upon him. He would
have had more; but the <i>Sanziack</i> told him, ’twas
enough; his Misfortune was not to be charged upon
me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Being</span> thus dismissed by the <i>Sanziack</i>, I came
the same Day to <i>Commara</i>, where I expected my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
Ague-Fit; but when the usual Period of it drew
near, I found it had left me, as if a Fever, got in
<i>Turkey</i>, durst not accompany me into the <i>Christian</i>
Territories. Hereupon I gave God thanks, who
had both freed me of my Ague, and had also
brought me safe to the end of my long and tedious
Journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> Days after, I came to <i>Vienna</i>, where the
Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i>, my most gracious Master, was
not at present, only I found <i>Maximilian</i>, King of
<i>Bohemia</i>, there in his Room; whole courteous
Reception of me made me almost forget the Toil
of my Journey. But I must tell you, I was so
emaciated with my Sickness, and the Inconveniences
of my Journey together, that many thought
the <i>Turks</i> had given me a poisonous Dose; for,
truly, when I went lately to pay my Duty to the
Arch-Duke <i>Ferdinand</i>, he asked one of his Domesticks,
who I was? who answered, I was one that
came lately from <i>Turkey</i>, and that it was no wonder
I looked so ill, for they, who returned from those
Parts, usually did so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Perhaps</span> he was willing to have it believed, that
I had taken the Emperor <i>Claudius</i>’s Dose; but, for
my part, I know of no such thing; neither do I
question, but after resting a while, to recover the
tediousness of my Journey, I shall look as well as
ever I did: I find my self something mended already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean time, I acquainted the Emperor
with my Return, by Letter, and of the half Year’s
Truce I had obtained; and the sum of my whole
Negotiation; and that, when he came home from
the <i>Diet</i>, I would inform him of all Particulars
more punctually and distinctly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> thing more I shall acquaint you with. There
were many Persons who refused to accompany me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
to <i>Constantinople</i>, either for Fear, or I know not
what other Motive, who wished they had given
me any Money to go along with me, now they
saw me return in safety. But what says he in <i>Plautus</i>?
<i>If you will eat the Kernel, you must take the
Pains to break the Nut</i>: He does himself Wrong,
that thinks to reap part of the Fruit, who took no
part of the Pains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span>, Sir, I have given you an account of my
Journey, both to <i>Constantinople</i>, and also to <i>Amasia</i>.
I have not dress’d up my Narrative with Flowers
of Rhetoric, but have presented you with it, just
as I would have related it to you by Word of
Mouth. I know you will bear with the Coarseness
of my Style, it being occasioned by my over-eager
Desire to gratify you; nor can you well expect
Elegancy from me now in my Heat and Throng
of Business, which I was never Master of in my
greatest Retirements. This I assure you, both for
your Information and my own Content, that I
am not conscious to myself of any Falshood in the
whole Narration, which is the principal Ornament
of such Relations as these. Thus I bid you Farewell.</p>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">I received</span> your Letter, wherein
you acquaint me, that you have
heard of my second Voyage into
<i>Turkey</i>; on which Account you
express your Wonderment, that I
would venture to visit that uncouth
and barbarous Country, once more. And withal,
you desire to know the Issue of my Journey:
How I found Matters at my Return to
<i>Constantinople</i>; what Entertainment I met with
there; what proportion of Health I enjoy; whether
my Life be pleasant to me, or not; and, in
fine, what Hopes there may be of my speedy return
to <i>Germany</i>. To all which you oblige me,
upon the score of our ancient Friendship, to give
particular and express Answers; which, to gratify
you, I shall accordingly do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Know</span> then, in the first Place, that you were
not mis-informed as to my Return into <i>Turkey</i>;
the thing is most true: Neither could I avoid the
Journey, as being oblig’d thereunto by Promise;
and you know every honest Man is as good as his
Word. My Case was this: The Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i>,
my most gracious Lord and Master, designed
me as his Lieger Ambassador to <i>Constantinople</i>; but
his Design was grounded on this Supposition, that
a Peace would be first settled betwixt the two Empires.
Articles of Agreement, however, being not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
yet fully accorded to, nor wholly rejected, there was
no reason I should slip my Neck out of the Collar,
till the Matter was brought to some certain Issue;
either a firm Peace, or a perfect Rupture. And
therefore, when I foresaw what a Bushel of
Troubles I should run my self into, by my Return,
I had much rather a fitter Person had been substituted
for the Employment; but no body being
willing to accept the Charge, I was, in a manner,
forced into the Service; it being my Duty to comply
with, and obey, the Will and Pleasure of my gracious
Master: For as soon as ever he return’d from
the Imperial Diet to <i>Vienna</i>, and was informed by
me of my Transactions with <i>Solyman</i>, the <i>Ottoman</i>
Emperor, he immediately laid his Commands upon
me to prepare my self to return, and to carry back
his Answer to <i>Solyman</i>’s Letters. ’Tis true, it was
the depth of Winter, when I was commanded to
return to <i>Constantinople</i>; and, besides, ’twas a very
rainy, cold and tempestuous Season; and my Message
too was so severe, that I was like to have no
Thanks for my Labour. Here, perhaps, you may
twit me in the Teeth, what! Twice to the same
Place? To which I answer, twice, and oftner,
if there be need; for commendable Enterprizes, the
mere hazardous, the more Praise-worthy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Twas</span> in <i>November</i> when I left <i>Vienna</i>, to undertake
my second Voyage to unhospitable <i>Pontus</i>.
I will not grate your Ears with the Relation of the
Enterprizes of my <i>second</i> Journey: I was too vexatious,
I fear, in giving you an Account of my <i>first</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may suffice to tell you, that I went the same
Stages, in a manner, that I did at first. So then,
to <i>Constantinople</i> I came, in the beginning of <i>January</i>,
having lost one of my Retinue, who died of
a Fever in the way. There I found my Collegues<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
in good Health; but a mighty Change was made in
the <i>Turkish</i> Affairs: <i>Bajazet</i>, <i>Solyman</i>’s youngest
Son, had escap’d a great Danger, and was reconciled
to his Father: <i>Achmet Bassa</i>, the <i>Grand Vizier</i>,
had been strangled, and <i>Rustan</i>, his Predecessor,
was restored to his Place of <i>Grand Viziership</i>, of
whom more hereafter. But, at present, I shall acquaint
you what coarse Entertainment I met with
from their <i>Emperor</i>, his Bashaws, and other great
Men among them. For their Bashaws (as the manner
is, before they introduce an Ambassador to their
Prince) being desirous to hear of me, in general, the
purport of my Message; as soon as they understood,
that my Master <i>Cæsar</i> would not recede a jot from
his Right, but did punctually insist upon it, as just
and equal, that the Transactions with the Widow
of <i>John</i> late <i>Vaivode</i> of <i>Transylvania</i> and her Son (being
made without Fraud, Force or Covin,) should
be strictly observed, they were in a mighty Chafe:
For you must know, that a long Series of happy
Success, hath so elevated the Minds of this People,
that they make their own Wills, forsooth, the sole
Rule of all Reason, Right or Wrong. On which
presumptuous Principle, they carried it very haughtily
towards us; and told us the extream Danger
we should run into, if we offer’d to appear before
that Prince with such an imperious Message. When
such menacing Words could not deter us from demanding
Audience, they gave us to understand,
that they would have no hand in our Admittance;
for do ye think, (said they) that we are such brazen-fac’d
Fellows as to bring you, with such sawcy
Answers, to our King? No, said they; it will be
a plain Mockery to him, which he will never take
well at your Hands. Do you not know, proceeded
they, that he is come back from <i>Persia</i> with a
victorious Army; where, his Successes have so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
exalted him, that he hath put his own Son to death,
as emulous of the Empire? Whereby you may
guess at the severity of his Passion. He longs for,
and courts, a fair Occasion to send his hardy and
well-disciplin’d Army into <i>Hungary</i>, to enrich
them with the Spoils of that Country, and to add
the residue thereof to his Empire. And therefore,
if you be wife, don’t rouze a sleeping <i>Lyon</i>; for
thereby you will but hasten your own Miseries,
which are coming on fast enough of themselves. Such
were the Harangues of the Bashaws to us; and the
rest of the <i>Turks</i> were of the same Mind. The
mildest Punishment they denounced against us,
was, that two of us would be cast into a nasty
Dungeon; and the third (which was to be my share)
would have his Nose and Ears cut off, and so sent
back to his Master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span>, to strike the greater Terror into us, the
<i>Turks</i>, who passed by our Lodgings, gave us many
a sour Look; which was an Argument, that they
intended some cruel Deportment towards us. And
the truth is, from that Day forward, they used us
more coarsely than ever; they kept us up close as
Prisoners rather than Ambassadors: They suffer’d
no body to come to us, nor permitted any of us to
go forth, and the rest of their Carriage was as intolerable.
Thus have they treated us these six
Months past; and I know not how long they will
continue these Severities; but, come what will,
we submit to the Will of God, our Cause is just
and honourable, and that gives us Relief against
their vigorous Extremities. But leaving the Narration
of our own Misfortunes, I shall answer your
Desire, in giving you an Account of the Story of
<i>Bajazet</i>. For the clearer Explication thereof, I
must acquaint you, that <i>Solyman</i> had five Sons;
the Eldest, begot by him on a Concubine, near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
the <i>Bosphorus</i>, was called <i>Mustapha</i>, of whose unhappy
End you have heard before; but by another
Wife, named <i>Roxolana</i>, he had four, <i>Mahomet</i>,
<i>Selimus</i>, <i>Bajazet</i> and <i>Giangir</i>. <i>Mahomet</i> liv’d till
he was married, (for the <i>Turks</i> call their Concubines,
Wives) but died soon after; so that <i>Selimus</i>
and <i>Bajazet</i> of this latter Venter only remain’d
alive. As for <i>Giangir</i>, he came thus to his end:
When News was brought to <i>Constantinople</i>, that
his Half-brother <i>Mustapha</i> was put to death, the
Youth, being of a timorous Mind and infirm Body
(for he was crook-back’d) fell into a grievous Passion,
upon the Imagination that the like Fate did
hang over his own Head; for he could promise safety
to himself no longer than his Father liv’d. If his
Head were once laid, he that was his Successor,
would certainly kill all his Brethren, as emulous
of the Kingdom; not one of them would be excepted,
and himself, being among the Number,
must look for the same Fate. This Thought
struck him into a Disease, even as if the Bow-string
had been already about his Neck, which cost him
his Life; so that now only <i>Selimus</i> and <i>Bajazet</i>
remained. <i>Selimus</i> was the Elder, and ’twas
known to all, that his Father design’d him for
the Empire; but <i>Bajazet</i> was most favoured and
doted upon by his Mother. Whether it were out
of Commiseration to prevent his inevitable Ruin,
or else out of motherly Indulgence, or whatever
else the Reason was; this is certain, if her Vote
could have carried it, <i>Bajazet</i> had certainly succeeded
in the Empire after his Father’s Death. But she
must give way to his Father’s Will, who was fully
resolv’d, come what would, that <i>Selimus</i>, and none
else, should succeed him. <i>Bajazet</i> was not ignorant
thereof, and therefore he turned every Stone
to stave off his impending Fate, and, if possible,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
to prevent his Ruin by grasping at the Throne.
And his Hopes were encreased by the favour of his
Mother, and of <i>Rustan</i> the <i>Grand Vizier</i>, who was
thought to have espoused his Interests. Having two
such Pillars to support him, he thought with himself,
’twas far more glorious to hazard his Life in
contending with his Brother for the Empire, than
to die obscurely by the Bow-string, as a Victim to
his Cruelty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Bajazet</i></span> having this Project in his Head, began
to pick Quarrels with his Brother, and to maintain
a Faction against him; neither was it long before
a proper Occasion offered itself for him to begin his
design’d Enterprize, of rising in Arms upon the
account of <i>Mustapha</i>’s Death, and the Disgust of
many thereupon. For the Truth is, <i>Mustapha</i>
was so well belov’d in his Life-time, and so much
lamented at his Death, that those who had placed
all their Hopes of Advancement in him alone, were
almost unwilling to live after him; so that they
did but wait for an Opportunity to revenge his
Death, or to die as he did. Others, who were
conscious to themselves that they had favoured his
Party, and therefore were obnoxious to the present
Power, did not care what Hurley-burlies they
made; ready they were for any Innovation, only
they wanted a Leader. In this case, they did not
well know what to do. As for <i>Mustapha</i> himself,
they knew he could not be recalled from the Dead;
yet it was in their power to suborn and set up a
feigned <i>Mustapha</i> in his head, as if the true one
had been yet alive. This Design pleased <i>Bajazet</i>
(who was the contriver of the Plot) best of all, as
most conducing to the accomplishment of his Purpose.
Hereupon, by his Emissaries, he procures a
mean Fellow, but bold and ready witted, to counterfeit
himself to be <i>Mustapha</i>; and his Pretence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
was the more plausible, because his Stature, Physiognomy
and Meen of his Body did somewhat resemble
<i>Mustapha</i>’s. This Man began first, to shew
himself in that part of <i>Thrace</i> which was above
<i>Constantinople</i>, towards the <i>Danube</i>, <i>Moldavia</i>,
and <i>Valachia</i>. This Place he thought the most opportune
to raise a Party, because it was full of
Horse; and that part of the <i>Turkish Militia</i> did
most favour <i>Mustapha</i>. Here he starts up, as if he
had fled in Post-haste from some remote Place, with
a few in his Company; which he pretended were
for his own Security. His Followers being asked
by the Country, who he was? They answered,
at first, whisperingly, that he was <i>Mustapha</i>.
Hereupon they were more desirous to know the
Truth; and then he was forced to declare himself,
that he was <i>Mustapha</i>, indeed. Having made this
prosperous Beginning, he goes on to congratulate
his Safety among them, and to give God thanks.
<i>First</i>, he told them, <i>That, when he was sent for
by his angry Father, he durst not trust himself to
come into his Presence; but, by his Friend’s Advice,
suborned one, somewhat like him, to represent
his Person, that, by another Man’s Hazard
rather than his own, he might make Trial of his
incensed Father’s Inclination towards him. This
Man he hired with great Promises of Reward;
but as soon as he came to his Father, he was strangled
at his Tent-door, before he had any opportunity
to make his Defence; and his dead Body was exposed
to the View of the Soldiery. At which time</i>,
said he, <i>there were some few that smelt out the Project;
but most part was deceived by the disguised
Lineaments of the deceased Body, and thought it
was he himself that was slain. As soon as I heard
of this</i>, said he, <i>I saw there was no Stay for me,
but I must consult my Safety by a speedy Flight.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
I took but few in my Company, that I might be
the less taken notice of and thus passing over
<span class="antiqua">Pontus</span> and the <span class="antiqua">Bosphoran</span> Country, I am</i>, said
he, <i>come hither; where I promise my self much
Aid from your Fidelity, and, therefore, I beseech
you lend me your helping Hand; and, seeing
I am oppress’d by a wretched Step-mother, be
you as forward to help me in my Affliction, as you
were all ready to do so in my Prosperity. For my
part, I am resolved to revenge my Wrongs, and to
maintain my Life by force of Arms. For what
other Course, pray, can I take? I owe my Life to
my Father’s Mistake, who killed another Man instead
of me; so that I plainly see, what Fate attends
me, if ever I come into his Power. The
miserable old Man is imposed on by the enchanting
Passions of a Step-mother, whom he doats upon, and
by the Ministry of <span class="antiqua">Rustan</span>, to whatsoever Attempt
they please. But, thanks be to God</i>, said he, <i>I
have got some Friends left to revenge my Wrongs,
and to punish my Enemies. And, besides, I am
not quite daunted, but have a great stock yet of
Courage left; for I know that the <span class="antiqua">Janizaries</span>, and
most of all my Father’s Court are on my side; and,
then, upon hearing of my Name, I know all those
who lamented me, when dead (as they thought),
will joyn me, now they hear I am alive; only
be you pleased to vouchsafe me a favourable Reception,
and to protect me till sufficient Aid come in
to me.</i> These were his private, and also his public
Harangues, where-ever he came; and his instructed
Followers ecchoed forth the same Report;
yea, some Men of Note whom <i>Bajazet</i> had
suborned, sung Notes to the same Tune. Thus
a great party of Men, unknown to <i>Bajazet</i>, were
brought into the Noose. For the Matter was carried
on so cunningly, that those who knew <i>Mustapha</i>,
and saw him lie dead before his Father’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
Tent, yet were afraid to believe their own Eyes,
but suffered themselves to be persuaded, that this
was the true <i>Mustapha</i> indeed: Yea, some of
<i>Mustapha</i>’s Intimates, who knew this was but a
Cheat, were yet so overfond of his Memory, that,
blinded either with Fear, Grief, or Anger, they
were the first that listed themselves under this
<i>Pseudo-Mustapha</i>, as being weary of their Lives
without him; which made others certainly think,
that this was the true <i>Mustapha</i> indeed, whom
Report had falsely given out to be slain. And, besides,
the Impostor himself, by large Promises and
great Presents, which he said were the Relicks of
his former Acquisitions, (but indeed were the Supplies
that <i>Bajazet</i> had provided under-hand) did
not cease to cajole and engage his Followers. So
that in a very few Days he got a handsome body
of Men together, fit for a little Army; and they
encreased every day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Solyman</i> was made acquainted by
Messages and Letters, which the neighbouring
<i>Sanziacks</i>, had, in great trepidation, sent him,
what hazard he was in by reason of the resort of
such Multitudes, to this <i>Pseudo-Mustapha</i>; the
cunning old Man knew one of his Sons must needs
be privy to the Plot, and therefore, he made haste
to disappoint it; chiding his <i>Sanziacks</i>, by Letter,
that they suffered the Matter to come to such a
Head, and had not rather crush’d the Cockatrice in
the Egg; but, seeing they had been negligent hitherto,
he commanded them to make amends for
their former Remissness, and to send him presently,
the Traitor and his Followers, Prisoners, in Chains,
to receive their condign Punishment; and, to facilitate
the Matter, he would send Aid to them, by
one of his <i>Viziers</i>, <i>Partan Bassa</i> who had married
the Widow of <i>Mahomet</i> aforesaid. However,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
he advised them, if they would purge themselves
of their criminal Neglect, they should quell the
Insurrection before his Succour came. <i>Partan</i> had
but a few Troops with him; but they were choice
Men, eminent for Courage and Faithfulness. <i>Solyman</i>
took care to cull out Colonels, Captains, and
other Commanders of that Inclination for this Service,
as suspecting that others might have been corrupted,
or enticed to pass over to the Tents of the Rebels;
for, the Truth was, the ordinary sort of <i>Janizaries</i>,
upon account of <i>Mustapha</i>’s Name, did not
seem much averse from the Party; and, therefore,
did not care what further Confusions might enhance
the Danger on that side.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Sanziacks</i>, as soon as ever they received
<i>Solyman</i>’s threatning Dispatches, began to bestir
themselves, and to rouze up one another so that
happy was he, that could do most Damage to the
growing Party of the Impostor. Some of those
that were going in to him, they intercepted; those
that had already join’d him, they laboured to discourage
by terrible Menaces and Denunciations of
the Danger they were in. In the mean time, the
Forces of <i>Partan Bassa</i> were marching on, and
being almost come up to the Place, the Party of
the Tumultuous, which were not yet fully settled,
seeing so great Preparations, made against them,
began to be discouraged, (as is usual with Men in
such Circumstances) and to drop off one by one;
and at last the whole Body of them most shamefully
left their Leader, and shifted for themselves,
the belt they could. Their feigned <i>Mustapha</i>,
with his chief Partisans and Setters on, would willingly
have done so too; but he was so watch’d
by the <i>Janizaries</i>, that he was taken alive, and
sent Prisoner to <i>Partan</i>, who, with a strong
Guard, sent him to <i>Constantinople</i>. When he came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
thither, <i>Solyman</i> put him on the Rack, and by
that means found out the whole Plot; how his Son
<i>Bajazet</i> was at the bottom of it, and had resolved,
if they had not been so soon dissipated, to have
join’d them with a considerable Force, and so either
to have marched directly to <i>Constantinople</i>, or
else (if Opportunity had served him) to have fought
out his Brother; but being slow in his Actings,
his Design was nipp’d in the very Bud. When
<i>Solyman</i> had thus ferreted out the Design to the
bottom, he caused him and his Abettors to be
thrown into the Sea at Midnight, not thinking it
convenient to have the Matter divulg’d among his
own People, or that foreign Princes should be acquainted
with the domestic Differences of his own
Family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for his Son <i>Bajazet</i>, he was mightily exasperated
against him for his foul Offence, and was
meditating in his Mind what grievous Punishment
he should inflict upon him. In the mean time, his
Wife being a prying Woman, and therefore allowing
him but little space for his Anger to vent
and cool itself, at last falling into Discourse with
him of the Affair, she began to excuse her Son,
laying all the Fault on his youthful Imprudence;
and that some of his Ancestors also had been necessitated
to undertake the like Attempts. For (says
she) ’tis a natural Instinct in all Men to do what
they can for themselves and their Friends, and to
save their Lives, if they can; especially, young
Men, in the fervour of Youth, are apt to be drawn
aside by ill Counsellors to pernicious Attempts;
and, therefore, it was but reasonable that his first
Fault should be pardoned, because, if he repented,
his Father had gained a great Point in preserving
his Son; but if he relapsed again into the
same Crime, then the Father was at liberty to inflict<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
deserved Punishment on him, for both Offences,
at one and the same time. But, proceeded
she, if you will not pardon him for his own
sake, yet be pleased to do it for mine; and spare
our own common Flesh and Blood: For how,
think you, can I bear it, that, of two Sons which
God hath yet left me, your Severity should rend
one of them from me? And, therefore, she intreated
him to moderate his Anger, and not to let
loose the Reins to Cruelty, though he had never
so just an Occasion. Almighty God (said she)
though most Powerful and Just, yet doth not always
exert his highest Severities, but tempers them
with Indulgence, else Mankind would be quickly
destroyed. And, if Clemency may be shew’d to
any, to whom, pray, more properly than to a Man’s
own Children? <i>Bajazet</i>, for the future, will certainly
keep within the bounds of his Duty, and the
Fear, wherein he now is, will certainly be turned
into the highest Degree of filial Obedience for the
future. If you please to spare his Life, the Sense
of your Indulgence will work this; for nothing is
so obliging to generous Minds as Courtesies received.
The Memory of his Pardon will restrain him from
running a second time into the like Offence; and
I my self will undertake for him, that for the future
he will carry it towards you, as a most dutiful and
obedient Son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">To</span> these Intreaties she added Tears and Caresses,
so that the old Man, who was Uxorious
enough before, could no longer withstand
her Importunities, but changed his Mind; and,
instead of punishing, resolved to pardon his Son;
but on this Condition, that he was to come into
his Presence, and receive his Commands. His
Mother, being exceeding glad at the good Success
of her Interposal, was not wanting to the Occasion;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
but presently acquainted <i>Bajazet</i> by Letters
that, whenever he was sent for, he should not scruple
in the least to come to his Father, for she had
wrought a Reconciliation betwixt them, so that not
the least spark of Discontent lay now covered in his
Mind against him. Upon the Receipt of this good
News, <i>Bajazet</i> resolves to trust his Father, yet
not without some Relicks of Fear; he reflected
ever and anon on his Brother <i>Mustapha</i>, whose Example
warned him of the Danger he underwent.
However, conquering his Fear, come he did to
the place of Conference appointed by his Father;
it was called <i>Carestrane</i>, some few Miles distant
from <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> must know; that, now-a-days, ’tis the
custom of the <i>Turkish</i> Emperors, never to permit
any one of their Sons, when once they are grown
up, to set their Foot within the Gates of <i>Constantinople</i>,
(whilst they are alive) for fear they should
ingratiate themselves with the Soldiery, and so set
up for themselves. As he was alighting from his
Horse, some of his Father’s Servants were at hand
to take away his Sword and Dagger. This struck
his guilty Conscience into a little Fear, though it
were accustomed to be done to others, that they
might come unarmed into their Emperor’s Presence:
But his Mother, who had placed her self on
purpose near his Passage, looked out at a Window,
using these Expressions, <i>Chear up, chear up, my
Son!</i> By which Antidote he was very much
heartened and relieved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as ever he came into his Father’s Presence,
the old Man bid him sit down, and then began
to blame him very severely for his Rashness, in
taking up Arms so causelesly. They may be looked
upon, said he, as taken up against my self: But,
grant you took them up only against your Brother,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
yet it takes off little from your Offence; for, if you
had had your Wish, the <i>Ottoman</i> Religion would
have been quite shaken, if not overthrown, by the
domestic Discords among our Family, (on the
Heirs whereof it doth depend); so that, if you be a
true <i>Mussulman</i>, such a Crime ought to have been
far from your Thoughts. I might aggravate your
Crime (said he) by telling you, that you aspired to
the Government in my Life-time, which is so contemptuous
a Thing, that your Offence is almost
inexpiable: Nevertheless, I am resolved to pardon
you, and to shew my self a loving Father, rather
than a just Judge, that so for the future you may
leave all to God; for Kingdoms, and the Governments
of them are not disposed of by Man’s Pleasure,
but by the Will of God. If he hath decreed
that you shall have the Kingdom after me, no
Man living will be able to hinder it: But, if God
had otherwise determined, ’twas a mad Thing in
you to go about to resist his Will; for that were
to fight against God. And, therefore, let me advise
you to be quiet; and not disturb your peaceable
Brother, nor interrupt the Quiet of my old
Age; for, I will assure you, if you commit a second
Offence of this Nature, I will be so far from
Pardoning you, that you shall have the Severity of
Justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Bajazet</i></span>’s Answer was very submissive, acknowledging
his Fault, and promising Subjection for the
future. Whereupon <i>Solyman</i> called for Drink,
and caused it to be given to his Son, (as the Custom
is) which was a Sherbet, made of Sugar, and the
Juice of certain Fruit. <i>Bajazet</i> had rather have
let it alone, as fearing it might have been his last
Draught, but he could not handsomely refuse it:
So he drank a little, and his Father drank a little
after him; which freed him of his Fear. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
<i>Bajazet</i> was dismissed, and sent away to his Government,
his Congress with his Father having
been far more auspicious, than his Brother <i>Mustapha</i>’s
was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the Death of <i>Achmet Bassa</i>, another of
your Enquiries, I shall give this short Relation.
Some say, he was put to Death for being too much
affected to <i>Mustapha</i>, and for favouring underhand
the counterfeit <i>Mustapha</i>, and encouraging <i>Bajazet</i>
in his Designs. Others say, that being a mere
Robber or Swash-Buckler at first, but advanced for
his Audacity, Valour and Skill in military Affairs,
to that high Dignity, the Punishment of his former
flagitious Life, was only deferred to the last
Period of it. And some were of Opinion, he was
executed only to make Way for <i>Rustan</i>; for <i>Solyman</i>,
having promised <i>Achmet</i> never to take away
the Seal from him, so long as he lived, to make a
collusive Performance of his Word, he caused him
to be put to Death, before he did it. Some said,
that <i>Solyman</i> gave it out, ’Twas better to die once,
than a thousand Times over; for the Fear of the
Loss of his <i>Grand Viziership</i>, and much more his
Survival thereupon, would have been as a thousand
Deaths to him. Whatever was the Cause, the
Manner of it was this: He came early in the
Morning into the Divan, (or Council-Chamber)
being ignorant of what was designed against him:
By and by comes the Messenger to him from the
<i>Sultan</i>, telling him, that he must die. He was
a Man of a great Spirit, and received the Message
as undauntedly, as if it had nothing concerned
him; only, when the Executioner drew near,
to do his Office, he pushed him away, as thinking
it dishonourable for a Man of his Dignity
to die by the Hands of an ordinary Executioner:
But, casting his Eyes round about the Company,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
he espied a creditable Person, that was his
Friend; him he desired to do that last Office
for him, and he should take it as a great Kindness
at his Hands. His Friend, upon his iterated
Request, undertook it: Only <i>Achmet</i> advised,
not to draw the Cord, or Bow-string, so as
to dispatch him at once, but when he had strained
it a little, then to remit it, that he might
breath a while, and afterwards to pull it as hard
as he could, until he were dead; wherein his
Desire was answered. Thus <i>Achmet</i> was willing
to taste (as it were) of Death, before he
drank his full Draught of it. Upon his Decease
<i>Rustan</i> had the <i>Grand-Viziership</i> bestowed upon
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for my Return out of this Country, which
you desire to hear of, all I can say is, <i>Facilis descensus
Averni</i>. He that brought me hither, will,
when he sees good, bring me back: In the Interim,
I solace my self in the Company of my
old Friends, my Books, which never fail to afford
me Relief both Day and Night.</p>

my self, both in my Solitudes and Sufferings?
And whether I go abroad, or always stay at home?
All these Demands put together, will engage me
to write rather Commentaries or Diaries, than a
single Letter, especially, since you are very earnest
to know, how <i>Bajazet</i>’s Matters stand, concerning
which, you say, there are various Reports
with you. You claim a Promise from me, and
unless I perform it, you tell me you will commence
an Action against me, and have already drawn
your Breviat. To pursue your Metaphor, let
me persuade you to stay a while, <i>Leniter qui sæviunt,
sapiunt magis</i>, says the old Proverb, no Haste to
kill true Men: But if you are so much given to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
Law, take Use and Principal too, rather than I
will answer your Suit, for I am averse from <i>Lawing</i>.
And besides, the distance of Place is so great
between us, that if I should put in an Exception to
your <i>Plea</i>, yet your Writ would hardly abate.
But, however it be, I will rather satisfy your Desires,
than contend with you in the least. When my
Collegues (whose Names I gave you in my last
Letters) perceived, that our three Years Abode in
this Place had produced little Good hitherto, either
to the making of a firm Peace, or the continuing
the Truce; and that small Hopes of either did appear
for the future, they laboured with Might and
Main to be dismissed by this Court; and when,
with much ado, <i>Solyman</i>’s Consent was obtained
therein, (for ’tis no easy matter to get a Dismission
from hence) the only Question was, whether we
should all go, or only those of us that came first,
and so had been longest there? For cunning <i>Solyman</i>,
that he might not seem over desirous of
Peace, by retaining one of us, remitted the Matter
wholly to our own Choice. In these Circumstances,
my Companions thought it very adviseable,
and for our Master’s Service, that one of us
should stay behind; and I my self was of the same
Mind: But we resolved to dissemble our Sentiments,
and conceal them from the <i>Turks</i>, so that,
as often as we had any Discourse with them on that
Subject, I always pretended an utter Unwillingness
to stay behind. ’Tis true, I told them I came
thither to reside as Ambassador in Ordinary; but
it was on Supposition, that Peace would be made
between both Empires. That not being yet done,
I did not see how I could well stay, but to the
Damage, and against the Will of my Master, and
therefore it was best that we should all return together.
Thus I reasoned before them, that so I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
might stay on better Terms, rather by their Entreaty
than by my own voluntary Offer. I knew
well enough, that, if we all went away, it would
not only open a wide Door for a War, but it
would even quite shut out all Hopes of Peace;
which latter was not despaired of, if I staid behind:
For, whilst Dispatches were sent to and from both
Princes, it would spin out a great deal of Time, in
which Interval something or other might fall out
of advantage to our Cause; so that it was better
to do any thing, than to precipitate our selves into
a fierce and cruel War; and yet I was not ignorant,
how prejudicial my Stay would be to my
self, for thereby my Care and Labour would be
doubled, in regard one was to do the Work of two
or three: Besides, many Inconveniencies might occasionally
arise, especially, if the Issue of my Transactions
did terminate in a War: And yet, I must
tell you, he that undertakes the Office of a public
Ambassador, must post-pone all such private Difficulties,
and make light of them, in comparison
of the public Good of his Prince and Country.
And I had a fair Opportunity to manage this Affair
by the Complaisance of <i>Rustan</i>, who was very
desirous of my Stay; for that subtle <i>Vizier</i> easily
foresaw, what a shrewd Step towards a War it
would be, if we should all be gone and leave the
Negotiation for a Peace unfinished. The old Fox
was averse from War, upon this Account principally;
he foresaw that, if <i>Solyman</i> made an Expedition
into <i>Hungary</i>, it was impossible to prevent
the Discords of his Children; for if <i>Selimus</i>
were willing to be quiet, yet <i>Bajazet</i> would attempt
Innovation, especially since he was favoured
by himself, his Wife, and Mother-in-law; and
such Commotions, he knew, would be fatal to
him: And therefore, when we were once at his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
House, he made a long Harangue to my Colleagues,
advising them what to say to their Master
at their Return, in order to a Peace. As for me,
he advised me by all means to stay behind, and not
to desert a Business so well begun, till it came to the
desired Issue; and there’s no doubt, said he, but
the Emperor, your Master, who always shewed
himself inclining to Peace, will approve well-enough
of your Stay. However, I continued deaf
to his Request, as far as with Safety I could, and
insisted on my Return; which egg’d him on the
more, to persuade me to stay: What, says he,
will you cut off all Hopes of Peace for ever? Our
Emperor longs for nothing more than to send an
Army into <i>Hungary</i>, and he had long since done
it, if I had not made use of some female Instruments
(meaning his Wife and Mother-in-law) to
dissuade him; yea, as it were to pluck him back
by the Sleeve; and therefore, if you be wife, don’t
rouze a sleeping Lyon to destroy you. Upon this
I began to yield a little, and was less peremptory in
my Refusal to stay; only I told them, my greatest
Remora was, I was afraid of their unjust Reproaches;
that, if Matters succeeded not as they
would have them, the whole Blame would be cast
upon me (though it was not in my Power to help
it) and therefore they would make me feel the Fruits
of their Indignation. But <i>Rustan</i> bid me be of
good Cheer, whatever the Event were; if unsuccessful,
it should not be imputed to me; if I
would but stay, he promised to take me under his
Protection, and next he would treat me (to use
his own Words) as if I were his natural Brother.
I told him, I would consider of it; and so we
parted for that Time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Day we were called into the <i>Divan</i>,
(so they called their Council-Chamber) and then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the same Part was acted over again; only <i>Rustan</i>
carried it a little more covertly, and reservedly, because
of the Presence of other <i>Bashaws</i>. There, at
last, I yeilded to stay behind, only leaving a Memorial
with them of this Import, that I staid behind
unknown to my Master, and therefore I would
leave all my Concessions to his Arbitrement, to cancel
or confirm: As for myself, I would be responsible
for nothing, nor oblige myself by any Promise,
whatever issue God were pleased to give of
my Negotiation. This Memorial was of great
Service to me afterwards, in difficult Circumstances,
so that the <i>Bashaws</i> could not, for shame, treat me
so severely in their Resentments, as otherwise they
would have done.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span>, Sir, you have an Account of my Stay
behind my Fellows, with the Reason of it. They
left <i>Constantinople</i> about the latter end of <i>August</i>,
1557. The Winter following, the <i>Grand Seignior</i>
went to <i>Adrianople</i>, as his Custom was, both to
strike a greater Terror into <i>Hungary</i>, upon the
Report of his nearer approach thither, and also for
the Conveniencies of his Hunting, (for there the
Winters are colder than at <i>Constantinople</i>,) both
which he thought conducive to his Health. The
Country thereabout is full of Marshes and Stagnant
Waters, by reason of the nearness of many Rivers;
so that there are abundance of Water-Fowl, as wild-Ducks,
Geese, Herons, Storks, Cranes, Bitterns,
<i>&amp;c.</i> To catch them, he makes use of Hawks, or
a lesser sort of Eagles, which are so used to the
Sport, that, though the Fowl fly up to the Clouds,
they’ll fetch him down from thence; but, if they
fly lower, then they truss them, and with a mighty
Force strike them with their Bills to the Ground. I
am told, that some of his Falcons are so disciplin’d
and expert, that they will venture on a Crane,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
even in that part of the Body where the Wing
joyns it; and by this means the Crane’s Bill can do
them no hurt, and so they tumble to the Ground
with their Prey: And yet sometimes the Hawk
pays dear for his Boldness; for, if he do but miss
his Gripe never so little, presently the Crane runs
him through with his Bill, and down he tumbles
dead to the Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this Reason, the <i>Grand Seignior</i> ordinarily
every Year, a little before Winter, goes to <i>Adrianople</i>,
and returns not again to <i>Constantinople</i>, till
the Frogs begin to be troublesome to him by their
croaking. Thither <i>Rustan</i>, a while after, sent for
me by Letter; he appointed some Horse to guard
me on the Way, and Sixteen <i>Janizaries</i>; whether
as a Guard to me, or upon me, I leave to you to
judge. We made long Journeys; for he advised
us to make hast. On the Third Day my <i>Janizaries</i>,
being on Foot, began to grumble; the
Ways were dirty, as is usual at that Time of the
Year, and they complained, that they were often
forced to march more Miles in a Day, than they
were used to do; and that, if their Emperor were
there, they could hardly endure it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> Complaints troubled me not a little, because
I was loth to disoblige this sort of People,
and therefore I consulted with my Servants, how I
might allay their Discontents, and make them willinger
to Travel. One of mine told me, he had
observed that they were much taken with a certain
kind of Caudle, Gruel or Pottage, which my Cook
used to make of Wine, Eggs, Sugar and Spices:
Perhaps (says he) if they have some of that for their
Break-fast, they will be plyable. This seemed but
a mean Expedient, yet we resolved to try it, and
the Success answered our Expectation; for, after
this sweet Soop, it being also further heated with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Glass or two of Wine, away they trudged as merrily
as could be, and told me, they would accompany me,
on the same Terms, to <i>Buda</i>, if I pleased.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came to <i>Adrianople</i>, I was forced to
hear the Railings, rather than the Complaints of
<i>Rustan</i>, concerning the plundering Excursions of
the <i>Hungarians</i>. And, by way of Answer, I was
as ready to complain to him of the frequent Depredations
and Mischiefs, which the <i>Turks</i> did in
<i>Christian</i> Countries. No marvel, said I, if we retort
like for like; for I had just then received an Express
from <i>Cæsar</i>, my Master, informing me, what
Breaches and Contraventions the <i>Turks</i> had made
of that Truce, which at the Departure of my Collegues,
was agreed upon: How they vexed the poor
Peasants with continual Inrodes, robbing them of
their Goods, and made themselves, their Wives and
Children, Slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> must not forget to acquaint you, that the same
Day, a Messenger came to me with an Express from
<i>Cæsar</i>, my Master. There happened an Earthquake
at <i>Adrianople</i>, from which he took an occasion to
tell me, that he perceived the same (so he judged it)
at <i>Nissa</i>, <i>S. Sophia</i> and other Places through which
he Travelled, so that the Air, included in the Bowels
of the Earth, did seem to have kept Pace with
him, by some subterraneous Passages or Caverns,
and to have travelled as far in a Day under Ground,
as he himself had done on the Surface of it. This
Conjecture afterward seemed to be confirmed, upon
the Relation we received of an Earthquake that happened
in <i>Constantinople</i> four Days after, which
seemed to be the same imprisoned Air, that had
made its Way, under Ground, even to that City
also.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> leave the Matter to your Judgment; but this is
certain, that Earthquakes are very frequent at <i>Constantinople</i>;
for once, when I was there, about
Mid-Night, my Lodgings did so shake, that it was
almost ready to fall. This Accident awakened me,
though fast asleep, and, having a Watch-Light
burning by me all Night, when I saw here a Cup,
there a Book, a Table, Board and Stone all tumbled
in a Heap together, I was at first astonished at the
Novelty of the Spectacle, till I had recollected myself;
and judging it to be the Effects of an Earthquake,
I then retired to that part of the House which
I thought most secure from falling. The same
Commotion of the Earth continued some Days,
but not with like Violence. Yea, over all that great
City, and especially in my Lodgings, and in the
Temple of S. <i>Sophia</i>, you might see the Walls,
though very thick, to crack and gape by reason of
the Clefts made by such Earthquakes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>; I staid about three Months at <i>Adrianople</i>,
made a Truce there for Seven Months, and in
<i>March</i> was attended back again to <i>Constantinople</i>.
When I came thither, I was quite weary of being
mew’d up in my old Lodging, it was so close, and
therefore I dealt with my <i>Chiaux</i>, (a sort of Officers
among the <i>Turks</i>, which serve for divers Employments,
of which Attendance on Ambassadors is one)
that I might have Liberty, as other Ambassadors
had before me, to hire an House at my own Charge,
where I may have the Benefits of Gardens, Orchards,
and a free Air to breath in. The <i>Chiaux</i> was not
averse to my Proposal, for he saw that the <i>Grand
Seignior</i>’s Interest was concerned therein, who
was wont to hire Houses for Ambassadors, at the
yearly Rent of 400 Ducats; and now all that Expence
would be saved: Hereupon I went to a House,
or Island rather, hired with my own Money, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
there was a broad Field adjoyning, which I resolved
to turn into a Garden, and to relieve my wearisom
Embassy, in managing and planting it: But, see
the Spight of it! When the <i>Chiaux</i> found, by Experience,
that he could not have so strict an Eye
over me in an open House that had many Ways to
it, with a large space of Ground near it, as he had
in a <i>Caravansera</i> (which Word you know the
meaning of, by my former Letters) because this
latter was fenced with Cross-barr’d Windows, and,
besides, had but one Passage into it, he began to
change his Mind, and thereupon made his Address
to the <i>Bashaws</i>, who by this Time were returned
from <i>Adrianople</i>, that I might retire from my former
Lodging: And I was to look upon this as a
great Courtesy too; for some of the <i>Bashaws</i>, in a
Debate betwixt them, concerning the Disposal of me,
were of Opinion, that, now I was alone, a less
House would serve my turn, and so some Charge
might be saved; But the more moderate Party carried
it, that I should return to my old Quarters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you desire a Description of the House I lodged
in, take it thus. It is situate on a Rising Ground,
in the most celebrated part of <i>Constantinople</i>; in the
Back-side of it there is a pleasant, but somewhat
distant, Prospect to the Sea, which yet is not so
remote from it, but that you may easily discern the
Dolphins skipping and playing therein: And also at
a vast distance a Man may see Mount <i>Olympus</i> in
<i>Asia</i>, which wears a snowy-white Cap all the
Year; it lies open to the Wind from every Quarter,
which by ventilating the Air, makes it more wholsom
and healthy. But the <i>Turks</i> are so envious to
their <i>Christian</i> Tenants, that they would cut them
off from as many Conveniencies as they can, and
therefore they do not only set Iron Grates before
their Windows, but also add Iron Boards and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
Planks to hinder the Prospect, and the free Passage
of their Air; and by this means they stop the
Mouths of Neighbouring <i>Turks</i>, who are apt to
complain, that they can do nothing in their Houses
but the Christians must overlook them. The House
is built in a Quadrangular Form, with a large Square
in the midst, wherein there is a Well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> upper part of the House, which is all of
it that is inhabited, is divided into Galleries, which
go round it, and into Lodging Chambers. The
Galleries look down into the Quadrangle within,
and without are the Lodgings, which have all a
Passage into them; there are a great many of
them, but they are small and uniform, as the Cells
or Chambers of Monks are with us. The Front
stands over against the High Way leading to the
<i>Seraglio</i>; and the <i>Grand Seignior</i>, every <i>Friday</i>
(which is their Sabbath, as the Lord’s Day is with
us) passes by it to his Devotions, so that Ambassadors
may easily see him out of their Windows.
And the Family, together with the <i>Chiaux</i> and the
<i>Janizaries</i>, do obeysance to him in the Porch, or
do re-salute him rather; for the Fashion of the
<i>Turks</i> is, that the Greater doth first of all salute the
Less, and therefore the <i>Grand Seignior</i> as he passes,
first salutes the People with a Nod of his Head;
and then they very officiously pay their Court to
him, with Acclamations and Shouts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> lower Part of the House is designed for
the Stabling of Horses; and, to preserve it from
Fire within, it is all built with Vaults or arched
Roofs, and without it is covered with Lead. ’Tis
true, such kind of Building hath some Advantages;
and it hath as many Inconveniencies to ballance
them: For all things are made therein for necessary
Use, but nothing for Delight and Pleasure. There
is nothing of Beauty or Novelty that can entertain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
your Fancy; no Garden belonging to it, to give
a Man the Pleasure of a Walk; there is neither
Tree, Shrub nor green Herb, to delight your Eye;
you have only many wild Beasts as your troublesome
Inmates and Companions. Snakes you have
in abundance, store of Weesels, Lizards and Scorpions;
so that sometimes when you would fetch
your Hat in the Morning, from the Place you left
it in the Night before, you find it surrounded with
a Snake, as with a terrible Hat-Band; And yet
these Animals afforded me some kind of Diversion
in my Solitude, (for you must give me leave to
tell you all my Entertainments). I once saw a
Weesel fiercely combating with a Snake, and
though the whole Family look’d upon her, yet
she was not terrified therewith; but though her
Adversary struggled, and made what Defence he
could, yet she victoriously haled him into her
Hole. Another Time I saw a Weesel carrying
her young Weesling from one part of the House to
another; and, as she was so doing, she leap’d down
upon the middle of the Table, where I and some
of my Guests were sitting after Dinner, having the
young one in her Mouth, which she very fairly left
among us on the Table, and skip’d no farther than
the Door, as if she had waited what Event would
betide her Youngling. When we had satisfied ourselves
with the Sight of that (yet sharpless) Animal, we
laid it down upon the Ground, and then the Dam
ran hastily, and snatching it up, carried it to her desired
Place. Another time I saw either a Snake, or a
Dragon, or a Serpent, trod to pieces by the Horse’s
Feet, in the Stable; her Belly was very big, and,
after I had caused it to be opened, I found three huge
Mice therein. ’Twas a wonder to me, how such
a slow and creeping Animal could catch so swift
and so running a one; and, after he had catch’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
him, how he could swallow him down, by reason
of the narrowness of his Throat and Jaws. But
my Wonderment was soon abated, when I beheld
another Snake seize upon a mighty Toad; and,
after he had him in his Mouth, he began at the
hinder Part, and had devoured a great deal of it;
and yet the Toad was still alive, and did what he
could with his Fore-Feet to deliver himself from
his Enemy. ’Twas in this very Posture, when
I saw it first; which made me admire, and to be
almost of the Opinion, that I saw a Monster, an
Animal with two Feet, and a Tail as long as a
Serpent; but when I drew nearer, and perceived
what it was, I hit the Snake with my Staff, to
make him let go his Prey, which at last he endeavoured
to do, that he might creep the nimbler
away; but, whether he would or no, the Toad
stuck in his Throat; yet, at last, when with
much-a-do, he had shaken him out, he could not
shut his Mouth, but continued gaping, in an ugly
Posture, till we killed him. Such a Staff, if we
may believe <i>Pliny</i>, hath a kind of magical Virtue
to help Child-bearing Women in the Time of
their Labour.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, for my Part, I was not content with the
Native Animals of that Country, but fill’d my
House with Outlandish ones too; and my Family
busied themselves, by my Order, to our mutual
Contents, in feeding them, that we might the
better bear the Absence from our own Country:
For seeing we were debarred of human Society,
what better Conversation could we have to drive
Grief out of our Minds, than among wild Beasts?
Otherwise, Stones, Walls and Solitudes had been
but lamentable Amusements for us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> these, Apes led the Van, which
making us good Sport, occasioned great Laughter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
amongst us, and therefore you should seldom
see them without a whole Ring of my People about
them, delighting to observe their antick Tricks
and Gestures. I also bred up some Wolves, some
Bears, some broad-horned Stags (vulgarly miscalled,
Bucks) and common Deers; also Hinds, Lynx’s,
Ichneumons or <i>Indian</i> Rats, Weesels of that sort
which you call Ferrets and Fairies: And, if you
would know all, I kept also a Hog, whose noisome
Smell was wholsome for my Horses, as my
Grooms persuaded me: So that, in my Nomenclature
of other Creatures, ’tis not fit I should omit
my Hog, which made my House to be mightily
frequented by the <i>Asiaticks</i>. They came thick and
three-fold to see that Creature, which is counted
unclean by them, and by the Books of their Religion
they are forbid to eat it, so that, it being a
prohibited Animal among them, they never saw
one before. Yea, all <i>Turks</i> are as much afraid to
touch a Hog, as Christians are to come near to
those who are infected with the Plague. This
Humour of theirs being known, we put a pretty
Trick upon them; when any body had a mind to
send me a secret Message, which he would not have
my <i>Chiaux</i> know of, he put it into a little
Bag, together with a Roasting-Pig, and send it
by a Youth: When my <i>Chiaux</i> met him, he
would ask, what he had there? Then the Boy,
being instructed before, whisper’d him in the Ear,
and say, that a Friend of mine had sent me a
Roasting-Pig, for a Present: The <i>Chiaux</i>, thereupon,
would punch the Bag with his Stick, to see
whether the Boy spake Truth or no; and when he
heard the Pig grunt, he would run back as far
as ever he could, saying, <i>Get thee in, with the
nasty Present!</i> Then, spitting on the Ground,
and turning to his Fellows, he would say; <i>’Tis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
strange to see how these Christians do dote on this
filthy impure Beast; they cannot forbear eating of
it, though their Lives lay at stake.</i> Thus he was
handsomely choused, and the Boy brought me
what secret Message was sent me. I kept also a
great many sorts of Birds, as Eagles, Jack-daws,
<i>Muscovy</i> Ducks, <i>Balearick</i> Cranes, and Partridges;
yea, my House is so full of them, that,
if a Painter were to draw it, he may take from
thence the Copy of <i>Noah</i>’s Ark. Besides the
Delight that I and my Family take in these Creatures,
to counterpoise our long Absence from our
own Country, I got also this Advantage by them,
that now I know, by Experience, what I could
hardly believe when I read it in Books. You
know a great many Books are full of strange Stories,
what ardent Love some wild Beasts have to
Mankind: I could never give Credit to such Relations,
but looked upon them as Romances, till I
saw with my Eyes, a Lynx, which I got out of
<i>Assyria</i>, so passionately affected towards one of my
Servants, though known to him but a little while
before, that for my part I could not think but she
was in Love with him: For, whenever he was
present, she would mightily fawn upon him, and
in a manner embrace him, and almost kiss him.
Whenever she was about to go away from him, she
would gently lay her Claws on his Cloaths, as labouring
to retain him; and, when he was gone,
she would eye him; and whensoever he was in
Sight, would hardly ever remove her Eye from that
Quarter. During the Time of his Absence, she
was very sad, but upon his Return she would skip
and be jocund; she could not endure he should
be at any Time absent; for one Time, when he
went with me beyond Sea, to the <i>Turkish</i> Camp, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
Lynx pined away by degrees, would not eat a bit,
but at length died.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> was troubled for his Loss, for I had designed
him, with another choice Ichneumon (which I
had) as a Present for my Master <i>Cæsar</i>; and the
rather, because of the exceeding Beauty of his Skin,
which made him look quite different from
other Lynxes: The best of the kind are bred in
<i>Assyria</i>, from whence this came, and their Skins
are sold here for fifteen or sixteen Crowns of Gold
apiece. I question not, but these were the <i>Babilonian</i>
Pells or Skins, so much famed and valued
amongst the Ancients, of which mention is made
in Law-Books; in the Title of <i>Publicans</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> you please to hear me, I’ll tell you another
story of a Bird: I have, among my other Birds,
a <i>Balearic</i> Crane, which differs from the ordinary
sort of Cranes by a white Plume of Feathers, that
grows hanging down from both her Ears; and besides,
all the fore-part of her Neck-Feathers were
black, and the <i>Turks</i> adorn their Turbants with
it; and there is some Difference in their Bigness.
This <i>Balearic</i> Bird was mightily affected with a
<i>Spanish</i> Soldier, whom I had redeemed out of his
Chains; when he walked abroad, the Bird would
walk with him, though for many Hours together;
when he stood still, so did the Crane;
when he sat down, she would stand by him, and
suffer him to handle her, and stroke down her Feathers,
whereas she would not suffer any body else
so much as to touch her; whenever he was gone
from Home, she would come to his Chamber-door
and knock against it with her Beak; if any
body open’d it, she would look all about, to see
whether he were in the Room; and, not finding
him, she would traverse it about, making such a
shrill Din and Noise, that nothing living could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
endure it; so that we were forced to shut her up,
that her Noise might not offend us. But when he
returned, as soon as ever she fixed her Eyes on him,
she would make to him, clapping her Wings with
such an antick Posture of her Body as Dancers in a
Jig use to do; or as if she had been to prepare herself
for Combat with a Pygmy. In fine, she at
last used to lie under his Bed at Night, where she
laid him an Egg. Thus I have given the story of
the Loves of brute Animals towards Man, now
prepare your Ears for another Story of a contrary
Import, <i>viz.</i> the Cruelty and Ingratitude of another
Brute towards Man. I had a Hart, that
lived very quiet and tame with me for many
Months; but, when her rutting or coupling Time
came, she grew on a sudden so wild, that, forgetting
all our Respects, she flew upon every body that
she met, as if she would have killed them with
her Horns, so that we were compelled, for our
own Security, to hamper her, and to shut her up
in a walled Place; but one Night, she broke from
her Prison, and ran amongst all the Horses, which,
as I told you, in <i>Turkey</i>, use to stand all Night in
the Yard, and where she made such a Tumult
amongst them, that she forced the Grooms to drive
her to her Hold; she wounded many of them,
which set them into a Rage, so that at last they
drove her into a large Stable, and there I gave
them leave, with what Weapons came next to
hand, to destroy her: She defended her self stoutly
at first; but they, being forty to one, at last
felled her, and made her pay for her breach of
Hospitality. When she was dead, I cut her in
pieces, and made a Feast for the Ambassadors that
then resided at <i>Constantinople</i>. It was a Hart or
Stag, of a huge Bulk, such as use to come in the
beginning of <i>Autumn</i>, out of <i>Hungary</i> into <i>Austria</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
at rutting Times. I bought him of some Beggars,
that made a Gain of that Trade; they used to
carry him about, and where they ask’d Alms for
God’s Sake, at the name of God they used to bow
their Heads, and the Stag by Custom had learned
to do so too; so that the Vulgar did admire the
Beast, as if he had some Sense of a Deity, and
therefore he got a deal of Gain to his Keepers.
This Stag, by reason of his Talness, I also designed
as a Present to <i>Cæsar</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> made mention of <i>Turkish</i> Beggars,
give me leave to acquaint you with the nature of
those kind of People in this Country. There are
fewer Beggars here than amongst us, and they are
commonly Pilgrims that travel up and down, pretending
some appearance of Piety or religious Profession.
Some of them, besides their Poverty, pretend
Distraction and Simplicity; and this sort is
very much esteemed among them, for the <i>Turks</i>
count all Madmen and Fools to be certainly designed
for Heaven; and therefore they look upon
them as Demi-Gods here on Earth. Some of
those Wanderers are <i>Arabians</i>, who carry Banners
before them, wherewith, as they say, their Ancestors
fought against the Christians, for the Propagation
of the <i>Mussulman</i> Religion. Those that
are of this Rank are not ordinary Beggars, neither
do they ask Alms of all Passengers, but in the
Evening they offer you a Tallow-Candle, a
Lemon or a Pomegranate, and force it upon you;
but you must give them double or treble the
Worth; and by this means they seem rather to sell
than to receive <i>gratis</i>. For the rest, they which
beg amongst Christians are set to do servile Offices
amongst the <i>Turks</i>. If a Slave become lame,
his Master is bound to maintain him, and yet the
veriest Cripple amongst them brings in his Master<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
some Profit. I remember, once I redeemed a
<i>Spanish</i> Officer, bought by a <i>Turk</i>, who was
maimed in all his Limbs, by reason of his Wounds,
and yet his Master found means how to make him
get his Living; he sent him over into <i>Asia</i>, to look
to the Flocks of Geese which he kept there; and
by his Care in feeding them, he brought in sufficient
Gain to his Matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> we talk of Slaves, give me leave to digress
a little, and to propose a <i>Quære</i>, whether he did
well or ill with <i>Christendom</i>, who first brought up the
use of Slaves among them? I know there are many
Inconveniencies that attend the Condition of
Slaves, but they are over-balanced by the Advantages
accruing thereby; especially if a just and
merciful Slavery were allowed by some public
Law, as was of old among the <i>Romans</i>; for then,
perhaps, we should not need so many Gallows’s
and Gibbets as we have among us, to restrain those,
who set an high Price on their Life and Liberty;
to maintain which, their Poverty prompts them
to the most audacious Attempts: Liberty,
without an Estate to maintain it, is none of
the best Counsellors. All Men cannot bear
Poverty and Freedom; Mankind, in general, is
not so form’d by Nature, as to rightly to govern
himself. No, he stands in need of a better
and wiser Conduct than his own; otherwise,
there will be no end of his Transgressing;
for so some Beasts will always be terrible to
Men, unless their Fierceness be restrain’d by Manacles
and Bonds. But in this case of Slavery, the
weaker Mind of the Slave is govern’d and steer’d
by the Authority of his Patron or Master; and,
on the other side, the Master is maintained by the
Labour of his Slave. The Truth is, both publickly
and privately, the <i>Turks</i> make a very great Advantage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of their Slaves; if any Houshold-work be
to be done, the Slave is ready to perform it; and,
therefore, they have a Proverb among them, <i>He
can never be poor, that hath but one Slave</i>. But
then for Works without Doors, if there be any
Rubbish to be carried out, or Preparation made for
any great Building, the assiduity of Slaves quickly
performs what is enjoined them. This I take to
be one Reason, why our present Buildings do not arrive
to the Magnificence of the Ancients; we want
Hands (or Slaves) to carry on the Work. I might
instance also, that servile Hands and Heads have
been great helps to the Learned, to attain their so
much celebrated Learning and Knowledge. What
I have hitherto discoursed about Slaves, you will
look upon as an Amusement; and so, pray, take
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> I can a assure you of, that the <i>Turks</i>, in
their way, do make a huge Advantage of Slaves;
for if an ordinary <i>Turk</i> bring home one or two
Slaves, whom he hath taken Prisoners in War, he
accounts he hath made a good Campaign of it,
and his Prize is worth his Labour. An ordinary
Slave is sold among them for 40 or 50 Crowns;
but if he be young, beautiful, and have Skill in
some Trade besides, then they rate him at twice as
much. By this you may know, how advantageous
the <i>Turkish</i> Depredations are to them, when many
times, from one Expedition, they bring home five
or six thousand Prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Romans</i> of old, were not ignorant of this
gainful Trade; which made them set an high
Rate on 20 or 30 thousand Persons, which they
sometimes took at the sacking of Cities, as their
Writings shew. But a <i>Turk</i>, upon the like Sack,
would make ten times five hundred Crowns of his
Prize, though by the rules of their Religion they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
are not to make Slaves of any of their own Sect;
nor to disfranchize them, or set any Price on their
Heads.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return from this large Digression: I
formerly acquainted you with my Sport in <i>Hunting</i>;
it follows, in course, that I must say something
of my <i>Fowling</i>. The <i>Turks</i> are favourable
to all Beasts, as also to Birds; and especially to
Kites, because, they say, they eat up the Carrion,
and keep the Streets clean and wholsome; and,
therefore, abundance of these Birds fly up and
down the Town, as fearless of Gin or Snare, so
that they are almost tame; and when you whistle
to them, they come about you; throw them up
Meat in the Air, they’ll catch it with their Claws.
Once I caused a Sheep to be killed, and called
the Kites to prey upon the Entrails. I cut them
in pieces, and threw them up into the Air; by
and by came ten or twelve or twenty Kites, and
a while after so many of them, that they almost
shaded the House; and they are so bold, withal,
that if you hold out a piece of Flesh, they will be
ready to snatch it out of your Hands. In the mean
time, I stood with my Cross-Bow behind the Pillar,
and sometimes when I shot, I made the Tail
or Feathers of one or other of them to fly off, and
sometimes I gave one or two a mortal Wound,
and made them tumble down; but this I did privately,
when the Doors were shut, that so I
might not provoke the <i>Turks</i> to Indignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> must tell you, I have <i>Partridges</i> too (to acquaint
you with my whole Stock of pleasurable
Recreations). You would wonder, as I my self
did at first, how tame they are. They were
brought from <i>Chios</i> with red Feet and Beaks;
they were so troublesome to me, by standing at
my Feet, and picking the Dust out of my Velvet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
Pantofle, with their Beaks, that they might dust
themselves therewith, that, to be rid of the Molestation,
I was forced to shut them up in a Chamber,
where, in a short time, they grew over-fat
and died, as my Servants told me; yet <i>Pliny</i> says,
in a certain Place, that <i>Hares</i> and <i>Partridges</i> never
grow fat. You have yet but small ground
for your Wonderment; but, pray, prepare your
Ears for what follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Isle of <i>Chios</i> is full of these Birds, and they
live with the Inhabitants in their Houses; every
Country-man, almost, keeps more or less of them
under his Roof, as their Estates are, or their Minds
serve them. A public Keeper whistles them out
in a Morning, and they run to him in the Highway,
and follow him into the Field (as Flocks of
Sheep do their Shepherds with us): There they
stay all Day to feed and bask themselves, and
in the Evening he whistles for them again, and
then they covey together, and return to their old
Lodgings. The Custom arose from hence, as
they say: As soon as ever the Partridges are hatch’d,
the Country-men take them up and put them in
their Bosoms, between their Skin and their Shirts;
thus they carry them about a day or two, ever
and anon moist’ning their Mouths with their own
Spittle. This Courtesy doth so oblige the young
Birds (for Partridges, as well as other Birds, are
mindful of human Civilities, if I may so speak)
that they cannot forget their Fosterers; and yet
Care is to be taken, that they stay not out in the
Field all Night; if they do so two or three times,
they quickly forget human Hospitality, and return
to their own natural free Life in the open Field.
I have taken a great deal of Pains to procure such
a Fosterer of Partridges to send him to <i>Cæsar</i>, to
teach Emperors that aviary Discipline. ’Tis true,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
I never saw this done with my own Eyes; yet
so many credible Witnesses have affirm’d the
Truth thereof, and I believe it as well as if I had
seen it. And I give equal Credit to the Story, I
am now about to tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is so known a Truth in this Country, that
he were an absurd Man that would offer to
deny it. They that come to <i>Constantinople</i> from
<i>Egypt</i>, (as many do continually) affirm it for certain,
that Chicken are not hatched, as with us,
by a Hen sitting abrood upon them, but there are
some appointed Officers, that, in Spring-time, gather
all the Eggs of the Neighbourhood and put them
in a certain kind of Oven, which they make of Dung
and Trash heaped up together, and by the heat of
the Sun and the hot putrid Vapours, the Chicken
in due time, are animated and break their Shells;
and then the Owners come to claim the Chickens,
which the Overseers of the Work deliver out to
them, not by Tale, for that would be too tedious,
but by Admeasurement. I mention this
the rather, because I read of such a Passage in <i>Vopiscus</i>,
where the Emperor <i>Adrian</i>, being angry
with the <i>Egyptians</i>, inveighs against them with
this Sarcasm; <i>I wish them</i>, says he, <i>no greater
Curse, than that they may always feed on their own
Chicken, which, how they are hatch’d, I am asham’d to
tell.</i> So that, without Question, this was an old
Custom among the <i>Egyptians</i>; and, therefore,
<i>Adrian</i> upbraided them with their Food, which he
looked upon as obscene, being begotten by Dung
and Dirt. You may think, perhaps, that I am
mistaken; but I leave the Matter with you, and
shall now hasten to acquaint you with the rest of
my Diversions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Be</span> pleased then to know, that I have also a
breed of brave Horses; some from <i>Syria</i>, others
from <i>Cilicia</i>, <i>Arabia</i>, <i>Cappadocia</i>, together with
divers Camels, Sumpture-horses, and all Utensils
fit for a Journey. For I would have the <i>Turks</i>
believe, that I have now executed all my Master’s
Commands, and wait only for my Dismission to
return home, which I press with great Importunity,
knowing that, by reason of the present Discord among
them, and the War between the two Brothers,
I may obtain the better Conditions of Peace
from them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I take Pleasure in my Horses on other Accounts,
so especially when in an Evening I behold
them brought, one by one, out of their Stables,
and placed in the Yard, that so they may enjoy the
Night-Air in Summer-time, and rest more sweetly.
They march out so stately, shaking their
Manes on their high Necks, as if they were proud
to be seen; and they have Fetters on their Forefeet,
and one of their hinder Feet is tied with a
Cord to a Stake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is no Creature so gentle as a <i>Turkish</i>
Horse; nor more respectful to his Master, or the
Groom that dresses him. The reason is, because
they treat their Horses with great Lenity. I my
self saw when I was in <i>Pontus</i>, passing through a
part of <i>Bithynia</i>, called <i>Axilos</i>, towards <i>Cappadocia</i>,
how indulgent the Country-men were to
young Colts, and how kindly they used them soon
after they were foled; they would stroke them,
bring them into their Parlours, and almost to
their Tables, and use them even like Children.
They hung something about their Necks, like a
Jewel, even a Garter which was full of Amulets
against Poison, which they are most afraid of; and
the Grooms, that are to dress them, are as indulgent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
as their Masters; they frequently sleek them
down with their Hands, and never use any Cudgel
to bang their Sides, but in case of great Necessity.
This makes their Horses great Lovers of Mankind;
and they are so far from kicking, wincing, or
growing untractable by this gentle usage, that
you shall hardly find a masterless Horse among
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, alas! our Christian Grooms treat Horses
at quite another rate; they never think them rightly
curried, till they thunder at them with their
Voice, and let their Club or Horse-whip, dwell,
as it were, on their Sides. This makes some
Horses even to tremble when their Keepers come
into the Stable, so that they hate and fear them too:
But the <i>Turks</i> love to have their Horses very gentle,
that, at a word of Command, they may fall
down on their Knees, and in this Posture receive
their Riders.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> will take up a Staff or Club upon the
Road, which their Rider hath let fall, with their
Teeth, and hold it up to him again; and when
they are perfect in this Lesson, then, for their
Credit, they have Rings of Silver hung on their
Nostrils, as a Badge of Honour and good Discipline.
I saw some Horses, when their Master
was fallen from the Saddle, that would stand
Stock-still, without wagging a Foot, till he got up
again. Another time, I saw a Groom standing
at a distance, in the midst of a whole Ring of
Horses about him, and, at a word of Command,
they would either go round, or stand still. Once
I saw some Horses, when their Master was at
Dinner with me in an upper Room, prick up their
Ears to hear his Voice; and when they did so,
they neighed for Joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> yet this is usual and common to all <i>Turkish</i>
Horses, that they run forward with a stiff and
stretch’d-out Neck, so that they cannot easily be
stopp’d or hinder’d in their Course, but by fetching
a large compass about. This in my Judgment, is
the fault of the Bridles they wear, which all over
<i>Turky</i> are of one Make, and not contrived harsher
or tenderer, according to the Tenderness of the
Horse’s Mouth. I must also acquaint you, that the
<i>Turks</i> do not Shoe their Horses as we <i>Christians</i> do;
our Shoes are very open in the middle, but theirs
are broad-web’d Shoes, that so their Feet may be
less endangered in Travelling. Their Horses do also
live longer than Ours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> have seen a Horse of theirs as lusty at 20 Years
old, as ours are at eight; yea, they say, in the
Stables of the Emperor, there are Horses of 50 Years
old; and which, for some great Merit, are exempt
from Labour, and feed daily at the <i>Grand Seignior</i>’s
Charge. The <i>Turks</i>, in Summer-nights, when
the Weather is very hot, do not keep their Horses
in their Stables, as we do; but cover their Backs
with Horse-cloths, and so bring them forth into the
open Air (as I told you before); and for Litter, they
have only dry’d Horse-dung, which they save all
the Year long, and spread under them for their
Bedding: As for Straw, they make no use of it at
all, either for Litter or Feed. Their usual Food is
a little Hay, and a small quantity of Barley; with
this Meat they grow not fat, for their Masters love
lean Horses as being fitter for Race, and Burden,
than foul-bodies ones. The cover them with Horse-cloths,
both in the Winter and Summer, only they
are thinner in One than in the Other. This contributes
much to the smoothness of their Hair, and
is also a good relief to their chilly Horses, which
cannot endure the Cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> those Steeds, as I lately told you, I take a
great deal of Delight; when, about Sun-set, they
are brought out of their Stables, and placed in
a row in the Yard; where I call each Horse by his
usual Name, as <i>Arabs</i>, <i>Caramanian</i>, &amp;c. whereupon
they fall a Neighing and give a Glance of
their Eyes and stare at me. Sometimes I go down
among them, and give to each of them a piece of
Melon-rind out of my Hand, which makes them
know me so well. Thus you see, what Shifts I am
put to, to drive away my Melancholly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> have also six She-Camels, which I keep by me,
ready to carry my Baggage, as I pretend to the
<i>Turks</i>; but my true Design is, to bring them to my
Master the Emperor; if peradventure he, or other
Christian Princes, may have a Fancy to breed out of
them because of their great use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two things which the <i>Turks</i> make
mighty Advantage of, and those are <i>Rice</i> among
the Fruits of the Earth, and <i>Camels</i> among the
Beasts of the Field; both of them very convenient
in their several Kinds, for long Expeditions. As for
<i>Rice</i>, it is not easily spoil’d; it affords very wholsome
Nourishment, and a little of it will serve a great
many People. And for <i>Camels</i>, they’ll carry huge
Burdens; they will endure Hunger and Thirst to
admiration; and also they require little Attendance.
One Keeper will look after six or eight of them, and
no Creature in the World is more obsequious to his
Owner than the <i>Camel</i>; and for currying of them,
they do it not with a Curry-Comb as we do, but
with Brushes, as we do our wearing Apparel; they
rather kneel than lie down, on the naked Ground;
and in this Posture they offer themselves to be loaded;
if you lay too much on their Backs they’ll grumble
a little, and refuse to rise; for their Backs will be
easily broken under over-great Burdens, especially<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
in Ways that are slippery and dirty. I was mightily
pleased to see them stand all round in a Ring, and
with their joined Heads, take Water or other Food,
out of the same Bason or other Vessel, with such
agreement among them. When Fodder is scarce,
they live upon tops of Brambles or Thorns; and,
when their Chops are bloodied in gathering them,
they eat them down most sweetly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Scythians</i> send a great many <i>Camels</i> to
<i>Constantinople</i>; but the most part come from <i>China</i>
and <i>Assyria</i>: From those Countries, there are whole
Droves of them; and they are so cheap, that a
<i>Mare</i> of a good Breed is worth an 100 <i>Camels</i>;
wherein, perhaps, they respect more the Scarcity
of <i>Mares</i> than the Cheapness of <i>Camels</i>; for good
<i>Mares</i> are so scarce in that Country, that he that
gets but one, of that sort, thinks himself a very
<i>Crœsus</i> for Wealth. They try whether they are
good or no, if they can run down a steep Hill, and
not trip or stumble. When the <i>Grand Seignior</i>
goes upon a Military Expedition into the Field, he
carries above 40,000 of these <i>Camels</i> with him, and
as many <i>Mules</i> for Burden; and these he loads with
all sorts of Victuals, especially with <i>Rice</i>. They
also carry Tents, Arms, and other Utensils of
War, upon them; especially when he marches into
<i>Persia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span>, you must know, that the Countries over
which the <i>Sophi</i>, or, as the <i>Turks</i> call him, <i>Chisilbas</i>
of <i>Persia</i> reigns, are not so fruitful of Provisions,
as our <i>European</i> Countries are. The Reason is, because
the Custom of the Inhabitants is, upon the
Approach of an Enemy, to destroy all before them,
that so Fire and Famine may send him farther off;
so that if the Invader bring not great Store of Provision
with him, he will be in danger of Starving;
and if he once do approach his Enemy, yet he doth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
not presently open his Store of Provision, but reserves
it for his Retreat; which, he knows, must be
through those Places already wasted by such a Multitude
of Men and Beasts, that, like Locusts, have
before pillaged all the Country. Then, indeed, the
<i>Grand Seignior</i>’s Stores are opened, and some small
Allowance given out daily to the <i>Janizaries</i>, and
other Dependents of that Prince, enough to keep
them alive, and that’s all. As for others, it goes
hard with them, unless they have made some Provision
for themselves before-hand; and some of their
Soldiers, especially the Horse, are so fore-sighted that,
in Prospect of such Difficulties, they carry a led
Horse along with them, with Viands and other
things to support them, if need be. Upon this
Horse they usually carry some Blankets, that they
may spread abroad, as Tents, to defend them from
Sun and Rain; also some other Cloaths to wear,
and withal two or three Wicker Baskets, full of
the best Flower they can get, with a small Pot for
Butter, some Spice and Salt; with these, in case
of Necessity, they kill their Hunger. They take
out a few Spoonfuls of their Meal or Flower, and
pour Water upon it; then they add a little Butter,
and so seasoning it with Spice and Salt, they set it
on the Fire, and when it boils, it swells so that it
will fill a large Platter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> eat of this twice or thrice a Day, as their
Store holds out, but without eating Bread with it,
unless they have brought some Biskets along with
them: And with this thin Diet, for want of better,
they can live a Month or two, till they come
to richer Quarters. There are some of them who
carry dried Beef, grounded to Powder, in a kind of
Snap-sack; that’s a more nutritive and choice
Viand amongst them: And sometimes they eat
Horse-Flesh, for in a vast Army a great many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
Horses must needs die, and if any of them be more
fleshy than others, they make a great Feast for
hungry Stomachs. And those who have thus lost
their Horses, (for you must know that too) when
the <i>Grand Seignior</i> or <i>Vizier</i> removes his Camp,
stand in a row before him in the Way he is to march,
with their Saddles on their Heads, signifying hereby
the Loss of their Horses, and by that mute Sign
begging Relief towards buying a new one; and
their Prince gratifies them, at his Pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> the <i>Turks</i> surmount huge Difficulties in
War, with a great deal of Patience, Sobriety and
Parsimony, reserving themselves for more favourable
Circumstances. But our <i>Christian</i> Soldiers carry
it otherwise; they scorn homely Fare in their
Camps; they must have dainty bits, forsooth, such
as Thrushes, Black-birds, and banquetting Stuff.
If they have not these they are ready to mutiny,
as if they were famished; and if they have them,
they are undone: Their own Intemperance kills
them, if their Enemy spare their Lives.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I compare the Difference between their
Soldiers and ours, I stand amazed to think what
will be the Event; for certainly their Soldiers must
needs conquer, and ours must needs be vanquished;
both cannot stand prosperously together: For on
their side, there is a mighty, strong and wealthy
Empire, great Armies, Experience in War, a veteran
Soldiery, a long Series of Victories, Patience
in Toil, Concord, Order, Discipline, Frugality
and Vigilance. On our side, there is public Want,
private Luxury, Strength weakened, Minds Discouraged,
an unaccustomedness to Labour or Arms,
Soldiers refractory, Commanders covetous, a Contempt
of Discipline, Licentiousness, Rashness,
Drunkenness, Gluttony; and, what is worst of all,
they used to conquer, we to be conquered. Can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
any Man doubt, in this case, what the Event will
be? ’Tis only the <i>Persian</i> stands between us and
Ruin. The <i>Turks</i> would fain be upon us, but he
keeps him back; his War with him affords us only
a Respite, not a Deliverance: When he once makes
Peace with him, he will bring all the Power of the
East upon us, and how ready we are to receive him,
I am afraid to speak. But to return from whence I
digressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> told you before, that the <i>Turks</i> use to carry
their Arms and Tents on Horse-Back to the War;
but they are such as chiefly belong to the <i>Janizaries</i>,
for the <i>Turks</i> are very careful to have their Army
healthy, and fenced against the Weather; let him
defend himself as well as he can against the Enemy,
that’s to his own Peril; but the Public takes care for
his Health. Hence it is, that the <i>Turkish</i> Army is
better cloathed than armed. They are afraid of
Cold, as of their greatest Enemy; and therefore,
even in Summer-time, they are treble-clothed,
and their inmost Garment (call it a Waistcoat, or
whatever you will,) is made of coarse Thread, which
keeps them very warm. And, to defend them also
against the Cold and Showers, Tents are carried
about for them at the Public Charge; and every
<i>Janizary</i> is allowed as much Space in the Tent as
the Dimensions of his Body are; so that one Tent
can hold twenty five or thirty <i>Janizaries</i>; and that
thick Cloath, I speak of, is also supplied out of the
public Store. When it is distributed among them,
they take this Course, to prevent Quarrels; the
Soldiers are ranged in the Night in Files, in a Place
appointed for that purpose, and so many Cloaths
are brought out of the Store as there are Soldiers,
and every one takes his Dole in the Dark; so that,
if it be better or worse, he has no cause to complain.
And, for the same Reason, their Pay is weighed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
out, not told, to them, lest any one should say,
he was forced to receive light or clipt Money;
nor do they stay till the very Pay-day, but receive
it the Day before. The Arms that are carried
are chiefly for the use of the Horse, called
<i>Spahi’s</i>; for the <i>Janizaries</i> do usually fight on
Foot with Musquets, at a Distance, and therefore,
when an Enemy is near, and a Battle expected, the
Armour is produced; but usually such as is of an
old Make, and are part of the Spoils obtained from
former Fights and Victories: These are distributed
among the Horse; their other Armour is but a light
Buckler. You may easily think, how odly such
Armour will fit on a Man which is given out so
hastily. One’s Breast-plate is too narrow; another
Man’s Helmet is too loose; another Coat of Mail is
too heavy for him to bear. Every Piece hath some
Fault or other; and yet they must not complain:
They count it Cowardly so to do; for they resolve
to fight, be their Arms what they will, so great
Confidence have they in their Victories, and in the
frequent Use of their Arms. Hence it is also, that
they put their old Foot on Horse-service, which
they were not used to before; for an experienced
Soldier (they say) will do valiantly, either on
Horse or Foot-service. In my Judgment, the
<i>Old Romans</i> were of the same Mind, and especially
<i>Julius Cæsar</i>, who was wont to say, <i>That his
Soldiers would fight well, even though they were
perfumed</i>; for when he horsed the ten Legions,
upon a Conference he was to have with <i>Ariovistus</i>,
what was his Intent, think we? but that they
should fight on Horse-back, if there had been need,
though they were used to Foot-service before; and
we know amongst the <i>Romans</i>, their Foot-service
was quite another thing from Horse-service. But
if you say, <i>Cæsar</i>’s Design was only to horse his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
Men for Carriage, but to make use of their Service
on Foot, certainly he had run a great Hazard
thereby, if when <i>Ariovistus</i>’s choice Horse were
within a Stone’s Call of the <i>Romans</i>, and might
have fallen upon them, the Legion was then to
dismount their Horses, to be disposed of, and
ranged into a <i>Foot-Tertia</i>, or Brigade, in an instant:
With us, this would seem very absurd.
However it be, this is certain, that experienced
Soldiers will manage a Fight after a different Order
than we do; so the <i>Romans</i> did of old, and so the
<i>Turks</i> do at this Day, with too good Success. So
much for that Subject.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> return, further to acquaint you, how indulgent
the <i>Turks</i> are to all irrational Animals. ’Tis
true, a Dog is counted an obscene and nasty Creature
by them, and therefore they will not harbour
him in their Houses; but they nourish a Cat as a
chaster and modester Creature, in their Judgments.
This Custom they received from <i>Mahomet</i>,
their Law-giver, who was so much in love
with a Cat, that, when one of them fell asleep
upon his Sleeve, as he was reading at a Table, and
the time of his Devotion drew near, he caused his
Sleeve to be cut off, that he might not awake the
Cat by his going to the Mosque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">However</span>, though the <i>Turks</i> have so ill an
opinion of Dogs, that they wander up and down
the City of <i>Constantinople</i>, and have no certain
Masters, so that they are Keepers of Streets and
Lanes, rather than of any certain House, and they
live upon the Offal which is cast out of their
Houses; yet, if they see any Bitch great with
young, in their Neighbourhood, they give it Bones,
and some Relicks of their Table: This they count
an office of Pity amongst them. When, on this
Account, I blamed them for performing such Offices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
to a <i>Brute</i>, which they would hardly do to
a <i>Man</i>, though a reasonable Creature, like themselves,
and to be sure, not to a <i>Christian</i>; their
Answer was, that God had given Reason to Man,
as a Fence against all Perils, and yet he did abuse
it, so that if any Inconvenience or Trouble happened
to him, it was his own Fault, and therefore
he deserved less Pity: But God had bestowed no
Boon on Brutes, but some natural Notions and
Appetites, which of Necessity they must obey;
and therefore they were to be relieved by Man’s
Help and Commiseration; and for this Reason
they take it very ill, if any brute Creature be put
to Torment at his Death, or that Men should take
any Pleasure in tormenting them. This had like
to cost a <i>Venetian</i> Goldsmith, that lived here, very
dear, of late. The Story is worth telling. This
Goldsmith did delight in the art of Fowling,
and among other Birds, he once took one about
the bigness of a Cuckow, and almost of the same
Colour; he had no great Beak, but his Jaws were
so wide and large, that, when they stretch’d asunder,
they did gape most prodigiously, so that a
Man’s Fist might be thrust into them. The Man
wondering at this strange kind of Bird, caus’d him
to be fastened to the upper Lintel of his Gate, with
his Wings spread abroad, and his Jaws so extended
with a Stick, that he gaped hideously. The
<i>Turks</i> came often by his Door, stood still, and
looked upon it; but when they saw the Bird did
move, and was alive, then taking Pity on it, <i>Out!</i>
they cried, <i>What an abominable thing is this, that
an harmless Bird should be so tormented?</i> Whereupon,
out they call the Man of the House, and
drag him presently, by Head and Shoulders, to
their criminal Judge, where Sentence was likely
to be pronounced upon him, to be soundly bastinadoed;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
but the <i>Bailo</i> of <i>Venice</i> (so they call
their Ambassadors or Residents there) hearing of
the Matter, sent presently one of his Servants to
demand the Man, and the <i>Turkish Cadi</i> was so
merciful as to let him go; but many of the <i>Turks</i>
grumbled at his Freedom. Thus the poor Goldsmith
scaped a Scouring: I laughed heartily at the
Story, for he told it me himself, as coming often
to my House, and in what a terrible Fright he was
in for the time; and, to oblige me the more, he
brought me the Bird to look upon. ’Tis of the
same Form, as I lately described; it flies about in
the Night, and (as they say) will suck Milch-Kine,
so that I am apt to believe ’tis the Goat-Sucker
of the Ancients. Such Commiseration do the
<i>Turks</i> use towards all sorts of brute Animals, especially
those of the winged Kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Over</span> against my Lodgings there is a tall <i>Plane-tree</i>,
whose spreading Boughs make a delightsome
Shade; under that Tree, sometimes Fowlers sit
with abundance of such Birds to sell in Cages.
You shall have the <i>Turks</i> buy several of these Birds
for a small Matter; and when they have bought
them, they’ll let them fly out of their Hands.
The Bird presently flies up to the Tree; there
she picks her Feathers, and cleanseth them from
the Filth contracted in the Cage, and then she
spreads abroad her Wings, and chirps. The
<i>Turks</i> that bought them, say, don’t you hear how
glad this Bird is, and how he gives me Thanks for
his Liberty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> this be so, you’ll say, What! are the <i>Turks</i>
such <i>Pythagoreans</i>, that they count all Brutes sacred,
and will eat none of their Flesh? I lay not
so; but, on the contrary, they’ll eat any Flesh
set before them, either boil’d or roasted; only they
count Mutton the properest Meat, because Sheep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
are made for the Shambles, as they say; yet they
would not have Men to make a Sport at killing of
them, as if they rejoyced in their Torment. Some
of them will by no means be persuaded to kill
small Birds which sing in their Fields and Woods;
nay, they think it some Injury done them, to restrain
their Liberty by caging them up. But all
<i>Turks</i> are not of that Mind; some of them keep
<i>Nightingales</i> in their Houses, for the Melodiousness
of their Tunes, and in Spring-time they let
them out to hire, to sing. I knew some, that
carried <i>Linnets</i> about, so well instructed, that if a
Man shew’d them a piece of Money out of his
Chamber, though it were at a great distance from
them, yet they would fly up to fetch it; and if the
Man would not let it go, they would sit upon his
Hand, and so accompany him from one Room
to another, still pulling at the Money; and when
they had got it, as if they remembred their Errand
on which they were sent, when their Master
whistled to them in the High-way, down they
would fly to him again; and, as a Reward for
the Money in their Bills, he would give them a
little Hemp-seed. But I shall proceed no further in
such Stories as these, lest you should think me a
second <i>Pliny</i>, or an <i>Ælian</i>, and that I were designing
to write an History of Animals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> preceed then to other Matters, and shall give
you an Example of the Chastity of <i>Turkish</i> Women.
The <i>Turks</i> take more Pains to have their
Wives modest, than any other Nation; and,
therefore, they ordinarily keep them close up at
home, and hardly suffer them to see the Sun; but
if any necessity calls them abroad, they go so
hooded and veil’d, as if they were Hobgoblins or
Ghosts. ’Tis true, they can see Men through
their Veils or Hoods, but no part of their Bodies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
is open to Man’s View; for they have this
Tradition among them, that it is impossible for a
Man to look on a Woman, especially if she be
young and handsome, without desiring to enjoy
her; and by that Desire the Mind is excited, and
therefore they keep them all covered. Their own
Brothers have Liberty to see them; but their
Husband’s Brothers have not the same Permission.
The nobler and richer sort, when they marry, do
it with this Condition, that their Wives shall
never set a Foot out of Door; and no Person living,
either Male or Female, be the Cause what it
will, shall ever have leave to see them; no, not
their nearest Alliance in Blood, except only the
Father and Mother, who, at <i>Easter</i>, (their <i>Bairam</i>)
are permitted to see their Daughter; and, in
lieu of this Strictness, if the Wife have Parents of
the better sort, and she bring her Husband a large
Dowry, the Husband, on his part promiseth, that
he will never have any Concubines, but will keep
to her alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> other Cases, the <i>Turks</i> have as many Concubines
as they will, besides their lawful Wives;
and the Children of both are equally respected,
and have as much Privilege one as the other.
Their Concubines they either buy, or take them
in War, and, when they are weary of them, may
sell them in the open Market; only if they have
Children by them, then they obtain their Liberty.
This made <i>Roxolana</i> stand upon her Terms with
<i>Solyman</i>, in having brought him forth a Son,
when she was a Slave, and thereby obtain’d Manumission.
Hereupon she refused to submit to his
Will any longer, unless he married her; which he,
doting for Love, wou’d do, against the Custom of
the <i>Ottoman</i> Princes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> lawful Wife, with them, differs from a Concubine,
only upon the account of her Dowry,
which a lawful Wife hath, but a Concubine hath
not. And when once her Dowry is assigned
her, then she is a Mistress; Governess of the House,
and all the other Women under her. And yet
the Husband hath leave to lie with which of them
he pleases at his Choice; and when he makes
known his Pleasure to his Wife, she bids the
Maid of his desires prepare herself for his Bed; and
she obeys; perhaps, more joyfully than her
Mistress commands her. Only <i>Friday</i> Night,
which is their <i>Sabbath</i>, the Wife claims as her
due, and she thinks herself wrong’d, if her Husband
defraud her thereof; other Nights he may
lie with which of his Slaves he pleases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Divorces</span> are made among them for many
Causes, which Men easily pretend; and when a Wife
is divorced, her Dowry is restored, unless she be
put away on a dishonest Account: But Women
have but few; to instance some among those few,
this is one, if their Husband do not allow them
due Maintenance; and if they offer to abuse them
against Nature, (a Crime usual among them) then
the Wife goes to the Judge, and tells him, she
can no longer endure to live with her Husband;
when he asks the Cause, they say nothing, but
pull off their Shoe from their Feet, and turn it up
and down, which is a Sign among them of the unlawful
use of Copulation. The greatest sort among
them, that have abundance of Women, set <i>Eunuchs</i>
to guard them, not such as have only their Stones
taken out, but such whose Yards are also impaired;
because other wise they think, such as have lost their
Stones only, may desire the use of a Woman, tho’
not for Generation, yet for Pleasure. The great
Men also have Baths at their own Houses, wherein<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
they and their Women do wash; but the meaner
sort use public Baths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> <i>Turk</i> hates bodily Filthiness and Nastiness,
worse than Soul-Defilement; and, therefore, they
wash very often, and they never ease themselves,
by going to Stool, but they carry Water with
them for their Posteriors. But ordinarily the Women
bathe by themselves, Bond and Free together;
so that you shall many times see young Maids, exceeding
beautiful, gathered from all Parts of the
World, exposed Naked to the view of other Women,
who thereupon fall in Love with them, as
young Men do with us, at the sight of Virgins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> this you may guess, what the strict Watch
over Females comes to, and that it is not enough
to avoid the Company of an adulterous Man, for
the <i>Females</i> burn in Love one towards another;
and the Pandaresses to such refined Loves are the
Baths; and, therefore, some <i>Turks</i> will deny their
Wives the use of their public Baths, but they cannot
do it altogether, because their Law allows
them. But these Offences happen among the ordinary
sort; the richer sort of Persons have Baths
at home, as I told you before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happened one time, that at the public Baths
for Women, an old Woman fell in Love with a
Girl, the Daughter of a poor Man, a Citizen of
<i>Constantinople</i>; and, when neither by wooing nor
flattering her, she could obtain that of her which
her mad Affection aim’d at, she attempted to
perform an Exploit almost incredible; she feign’d
herself to be a Man, changed her Habit, hired an
House near the Maid’s Father, and pretended she
was one of the <i>Chiauxes</i> of the <i>Grand Seignior</i>;
and thus, by reason of his Neighbourhood, she insinuated
herself into the Man’s Acquaintance, and
after some time, acquaints him with the desire of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
his Daughter. In short, he being a Man in such
a prosperous Condition, the Matter was agreed on,
a Portion was settled, such as they were able to
give, and a Day appointed for the Marriage; when
the Ceremonies were over, and this doughty Bridegroom
went into the Bride-chamber to his Spouse;
after some Discourse, and plucking off her Headgeer,
she was found to be a Woman. Whereupon
the Maid runs out, and calls up her Parents,
who soon found that they had married her, not to
a <i>Man</i>, but a <i>Woman</i>: Whereupon, they carried
the supposed Man, the next day, to the General
of the <i>Janizaries</i>, who, in the Absence of the
<i>Grand Seignior</i>, was Governor of the City.
When she was brought before him, he chide her
soundly for her beastly Love; what, says he,
are you not asham’d, an old Beldam as you are,
to attempt so notorious a Bestiality, and so filthy a
Fact?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Away</span>, Sir, says she! You do not know the
Force of Love, and God grant you never may.
At this absurd Reply, the Governor could scarce
forbear Laughter, but commanded her, presently,
to be pack’d away and drown’d in the Deep; such
was the unfortunate Issue of her wild Amours.
For you must know, that the <i>Turks</i> make no
noise when <i>secret</i> Offences are committed by them,
that they may not open the Mouths of Scandal
and Reproach; but <i>open</i> and <i>manifest</i> ones they
punish most severely. I am afraid the Relation of
that dismal Example hath grated your Ears. I
shall, therefore, now endeavour to make you
amends, by acquainting you with a pleasant Story,
which, I believe, will go near to make you smile.
’Tis this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> the Account of the Troubles in <i>Hungary</i>,
there came lately a Messenger to me, with an Express<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
from my Master, the Emperor. The
<i>Bashaws</i> would not let him bring his Letters directly
to me, as they were wont to be brought,
but they carried him first into the <i>Divan</i>. The
Reason of this their unusual Procedure, was, because
they would fain know what <i>Cæsar</i>’s Letters
did contain, before they were delivered, in regard
they suspected I dealt not faithfully with them, in
communicating my Master’s Sense, but that I suppressed
some of his Concessions. The Messenger
was cunning enough for them; for, having some
inkling of the Matter before-hand, he hid <i>Cæsar</i>’s
Letters, and only shew’d them those that were
directed to me, from some particular Friends.
Their interpreter, <i>Ebrahim</i>, a <i>Polander</i> by Birth,
had acquainted them before, that the Letters, that
brought any secret Commands to me, were not
written in an ordinary Character, but in a new
kind of Marks, called <i>Cyphers</i>. As they were
searching all my Letters, at last they light upon
One, that was wrote to me by a Friend of mine,
a Secretary of <i>Burgundy</i>. <i>Ebrahim</i> saw, through
the thinness of the Paper wherein ’twas writ, some
shining Letters, which were not of an ordinary
sort. O! says he, now I have found it out;
don’t you meddle with any of the rest of the
Packet, for here’s the Secrecy in this. Whereupon
the <i>Bashaws</i> commanded him to open, read,
and interpret it to them, and they all stood listning
to hear the News; but <i>Ebrahim</i> told them plainly,
that he could not read one Letter of it. That’s
strange, says the <i>Bashaws</i>; what, did you never
learn the <i>Christian</i> Alphabet; or have you forgot
it? Says <i>Ebrahim</i>, this sort of Character is only
known to those who are Secretaries to Princes:
They did not well understand him; but however,
say they, if it be so, why dost thou not make haste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
to the Secretary of the <i>Bailo</i> of <i>Venice</i>, or of <i>Florence</i>?
<i>Ebrahim</i> presently makes haste to them,
and shews them the Letters; (they were writ in
might such a Character that a Child ten Years old
have read them;) but both those Secretaries,
when they saw the Letter was superscrib’d to me,
threw it back again before they had well look’d
upon it; alledging, in Excuse, that such kind of
Letters could be read by none, unless by him who
had another Cypher to unfold them. This was
all the Answer <i>Ebrahim</i> could get of them. Upon
his Return to the <i>Bashaws</i> therewith, they could
not tell what in the World to do: At last, starts
up one (I could not tell his Name) saying, there
is a Patriarch in Town, and old Man, and a <i>Christian</i>,
and, besides, a great Scholar; if any Man
can read these Letters, it must be he. When
they came to the Patriarch, he told them, he could
not read a Tittle of them, for they were not writ
in <i>Greek</i>, <i>Latin</i>, <i>Hebrew</i> or <i>Chaldee</i>. Thus they
were disappointed there also. At last, <i>Haly Bassa</i> runs
to <i>Rustan</i> (otherwise a Man not ready to jest) and
says to him <i>Cardassi</i> (Brother in <i>Turkish</i>), I remember,
I had once a Servant, an <i>Italian</i>, who
was skilled in all Letters and Tongues, I do not
question but he could have read the Letter; but,
alas! he is lately dead. At last, they being at a
stand what to do, thought it best to send the Letters,
which they could make no use of, to me. I
knew all the Matter by <i>Ebrahim</i> beforehand, (neither
could it be kept secret); whereupon I began
to stamp and fret that they had intercepted my Letters
against the Law of Nations, and in Contempt
of <i>Cæsar</i> who sent them; and, withal, I bid <i>Ebrahim</i>
stay, and to Morrow he should see that
Letter translated for the <i>Bashaws</i>. The next day,
when <i>Ebrahim</i> appeared in the <i>Divan</i>, they asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
of him, whether I could read those Letters? Read
them, says he! as easily as his own Name; and
thereupon he produced some of them translated
before them, <i>viz.</i> what I had a mind to discover.
Whereupon, says <i>Rustan</i>, this Ambassador is but
a young Man, and yet we see he can understand
what the old Patriarch could not so much as read;
without doubt, if he live to be old, he will prove
a very <i>Nonsuch</i> of a Man. For that reason it was,
or perhaps some other, that a while after, having
Conference with <i>Rustan</i> about our Affairs, he
treated me more familiarly than he used to do,
(which was a rare thing in him) and at last he
ask’d me, why I would not turn to their Religion,
and to the true Worship of God? If I would do
so, he promised me great Honour and a large Reward
from their Emperor <i>Solyman</i>. I told him, I was
resolved to continue in that Religion, wherein I
was born, and which my Master, <i>Cæsar</i>, did
profess. Be it so, replied he; but what then will
become of your Soul? I subjoined, I hope well
for that too; whereupon he, after a little Pause,
broke forth into these Words. ’Tis true, indeed,
and I am almost of your Mind, that they who
live holy and modest Lives in this present World,
shall obtain eternal Life in the next, be they of what
Religion they will. That’s an Heresy, that some
of the <i>Turks</i> have taken up, neither is <i>Rustan</i>
thought to be a true <i>Mussulman</i> in all Points. The
<i>Turks</i> thinks it a Duty, and a work of Piety in
them, to persuade a <i>Christian</i> they have any good Opinion
of, to their Religion; for then they think,
they shall save a Soul from Destruction, and that
they count a great Honour to themselves, and the
greatest Charity they can do another Man, to make
him a Convert to their Religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> shall now acquaint you with the Effects of
another Conference I had with <i>Rustan</i>, whereby
you may see what daily Feuds are between the
<i>Turks</i> and <i>Persians</i>, upon the account of Religion.
He ask’d me, one time, whether the War did continue
between <i>Spain</i> and <i>France</i>? I told him, it
did. ’Tis strange, says he, that they should fall
out that are of one and the same Religion: I replied,
’tis no otherwise between those two Princes,
than ’tis betwixt <i>you</i> and the <i>Persians</i>. The Dispute
is not about Religion, but about civil Right;
Provinces, Cities and Kingdoms, which both lay
claim to. You are quite mistaken, says <i>Rustan</i>,
we are not of the same Religion with the <i>Persians</i>,
but do count them a more Profane and <i>Heathenish</i>
sort of People than you <i>Christians</i> are. But to return
to the Affairs of <i>Hungary</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Since</span> my last Return to <i>Constantinople</i>, Matters
in <i>Hungary</i> have received a very great Alteration,
it would be too tedious to describe them particularly;
and, besides, it were not conducive to my
Design. <i>Isabella</i>, Wife to King <i>John</i>, is returned
into <i>Transilvania</i>, together with her Son, having
refused the Transactions and broken the League
made with the Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i>; and the <i>Transilvanians</i>,
terrified by the <i>Turkish</i> Arms, have again
submitted their Necks to the old <i>Ottoman</i> Yoke.
Matters succeeding thus prosperously with the <i>Turks</i>,
they are not therewith contented, but grasp at all
<i>Hungary</i> too; and, besides other Places, they resolved
to besiege <i>Sigeth</i>, which signifies in the <i>Hungarian</i>
Language, an <i>Island</i>, or Place naturally
very strongly situated. And for this purpose they
chose a General, who, upon the account of the
Prosperity of his Arms in former times, created great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
Confidence in his own Men, and struck as much
Terror into his Enemy: His Name was <i>Haly Bassa</i>,
an <i>Epirot</i>, who had had good Success in <i>Hungary</i>
before, and especially in the Battel, wherein he
overthrew <i>Sforza Palavicino</i>, and the Bishop of Five
Churches. He was sent for from the utmost Bounds
of the <i>Turkish</i> Empire towards <i>Persia</i>, and came
with great Expectation to <i>Constantinople</i>: My Collegues
were yet here with me, pressing for a Dismission.
’Twas the pleasure of the <i>Bashaws</i> that we
should see him, in regard we counted him, as they
thought, the very Thunder-bolt of War.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we came to him, he received us courteously,
and made a great Harangue to this purpose:
That, “we should study Peace, and rather than
suffer <i>Hungary</i> to be wasted with Fire and Sword,
we should accept those Conditions, which the
<i>Grand Seignior</i> had offered us.” We answered
him, that “we desired nothing more than Peace;
provided it might be had upon tolerable Conditions;
but those which they offered, were against
the Honour and Dignity of our Master.” Thus
we took our leaves, after he had treated us with a
Cup of Water diluted with Sugar. This <i>Haly</i>
was an Eunuch, but the Constitution of his Body
did seem to add to the vigour of his Mind: He
was low of Stature, bloted in his Body, of a Bay-coloured
Countenance, a sour Look, frowning Eyes,
broad Shoulders and sticking up, between which
stood his Head, as in a Valley. Two Teeth were
prominent in his Mouth, like Boar’s Tusks, his
Voice hoarse; in a Word, he was the Fourth
Fury.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Day after he makes great Preparation for his
Expedition into <i>Hungary</i>; where having spent some
Time to provide Materials, he at last marches against
<i>Sigeth</i>, and beats off those which were repairing <i>Babock</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
a Castle of <i>Cæsar</i>’s; but <i>Cæsar</i>, being acquainted
long before with his Design, lends <i>Ferdinand</i>, one
of his three Sons, a young Man, yet comparable,
for greatness of Mind, to any of the old Generals,
to oppose the Torrent of <i>Haly Bassa</i>’s Force, and
by his Valour to retrieve Affairs in <i>Hungary</i>: He
had no great Forces with him, but with a select
Body of Horse he faces <i>Haly</i>’s Army; the <i>Turks</i> that
were present, related to me, that ’twas a goodly
Sight to behold the Splendor, Order and Boldness
of those Forces. <i>Haly</i>, being naturally of a fierce
Disposition, and having a far greater Army, was
even mad to think that a handful of <i>Christians</i> should
dare to look him in the Face.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was a moorish Piece of Ground between
both Armies, which could not be passed without
great Danger; <i>Ferdinand</i> had no need to pass it, for
his Design was only to relieve <i>Sigeth</i>, and to raise
the Siege: But <i>Haly Bassa</i>, was not in the same
Circumstances; for, unless he would make a base
and unhandsome Retreat (as the Event afterwards
shewed) ’twas altogether necessary for him to do it;
So that he, seeing to what Straits he was brought,
resolved to put all upon hazard, and accordingly he
bent his Bridle, to turn his Horse towards that inconvenient
Place; when, behold! one of the <i>Sanziacks</i>,
that was near him, whose Name I remember
not, taking Notice of the extream Danger he
was running into, leap’d from his Horse, and taking
the <i>Bashaw</i>’s Horse by the Bridle, <i>Sultan</i>, says he (for
so the <i>Turks</i> call the great Dignitaries among them)
<i>Here you see into what a Jeopardy you were like to
cast both yourself and your whole Army; you don’t
consider what an incommodious Place this Marish is:
The <span class="antiqua">Christians</span> are ready on the other side with Arms
in Hand and Courage in their Hearts, to receive us,
when we are half drowned and half covered with Mud;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
and thus they in good Order will assault us, being disordered
and out of our Ranks, and will make use of
all our Imprudence, to obtain a most assured Victory
over us: Nay, rather moderate your Anger, and return
to yourself and reserve so many brave Men, with
yourself for the Service of your Prince, and for better
Times.</i> Upon this Speech, <i>Haly</i>, as if he had recollected
himself, drew back; and there was not any <i>Turk</i>
amongst them, but was forced to confess, that the
whole Army was sav’d by the Advice of that <i>Sanziack</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> this matter was carried to <i>Constantinople</i>,
though the <i>Vizier</i> and the Chief <i>Bashaws</i> could not
deny the Thing, yet they thought it dangerous to
suffer the Example of so audacious a Fact in the
<i>Sanziack</i> to pass unpunished: ’Tis true, they did
mutteringly commend both his Fidelity and his Prudence;
yet to suffer Disobedience to a superior Officer
to pass without due Punishment, they thought
it a dangerous Case in Military Discipline, so that
he was called back to <i>Constantinople</i>, and there was
cashiered for a Time; and when this Offence
was sufficiently punished, as they thought, they
bestowed upon him as good a Command; so that
every Body saw his Punishment was inflicted rather
for the preservation of the Discipline of War, than
for any dire Merit of his Offence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Haly</i></span>, a while after, having lost a great Part of his
Army, by the Charges and Ambuscades of the <i>Hungarians</i>,
made an ignoble and shameful Retreat to
<i>Buda</i>, where for very Grief he breathed out his
hateful Soul.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> Arch-duke <i>Ferdinand</i>, on the other side,
returned to <i>Ferdinand</i> his Father, with the deserved
Laurel of Victory, having performed an Exploit,
not only of great Advantage for the present, but of
much greater Benefit to future Ages, by the Example
it gave; for hereby he made the <i>Turks</i> to know
that if they proceeded on to press upon <i>Cæsar</i>, he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
wanted neither able Soldiers, nor expert Commanders
to chastise their Insolency.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yet</span> the <i>Turks</i> of those Borders did not carry it
with any great Modesty; for, while <i>Haly</i> was yet
encamped at <i>Sigeth</i>, our Men had scaled the Walls
of <i>Gran</i>, and taken the City, having a Castle near
it of the same Name, where they got a great deal
of Booty, and carried away the Inhabitants, being
mostly Women and Children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> Messenger was sent immediately to <i>Haly</i>, to
acquaint him of the Loss; who coming into his Presence,
by the very Consternation of his Countenance
portended some great Mischief to have happened
to them. The <i>Bassa</i> presently asked him, how
Things went? and what was the Cause of his great
Fear? <i>Sir</i>, says he, <i>the Enemy hath taken and plundered
<span class="antiqua">Gran</span>; which great Blow occasions my Grief</i>.
<i>A Blow, Fool</i>, says the <i>Bassa</i>! <i>tell me of a Blow
when I have lost my Genitals</i> (to which he pointed
with his Hand) <i>that shew me to be a Man</i>. Thus
did he scoff at the Consternation of the Messenger,
not without the Laughter of the By-standers, and
undervalued the Loss of <i>Gran</i>, which was easily
recoverable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Moreover</span>, in <i>Croatia</i> and the adjoyning
Countries, several Inroads were made by both Parties,
and each side did alternately suffer for their
over-boldness and supine Security. Let me give you
an Instance, which, as it gave me joy, will not, I
dare say, be unpleasant, to you to hear of. It
happened, indeed, some what before the Passage at
<i>Sigeth</i> lately mentioned; but in Writing an Epistle,
I do not strictly observe the Order of Time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">News</span> was brought to <i>Rustan</i>, from those Parts,
that a certain Confident of his, whom he highly
esteemed, and called Cousin, had fallen upon a
Party of <i>Christians</i>, as they were celebrating a Wedding,
and being at a sufficient Distance, as they
thought, from the <i>Turks</i>, counted themselves secure;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
when behold this bold and unwelcome Guest,
with Armed Forces, came in upon them, spoiled
their Mirth, slew some, and took some Prisoners,
among whom was the unfortunate Bridegroom,
with his un-bedded Spouse: <i>Rustan</i> did much rejoyce
at this Exploit, and in all Companies highly
commended the Stratagem of his Kinsman, for performing
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> pitiful Case, you will say, rather to be lamented
than related: But these are the Tragical Sports
of insolent Fortune; yet Revenge followed him at
the Heels, <i>Rustan</i>’s Laughter was soon turned to
Sadness: For a little while after one of the <i>Deli’s</i>, or
mad Sparks, a sort of furious Horsemen among the
<i>Turks</i>, so called by their outragious Boldness, came
post to him out of <i>Dalmatia</i>, and told him, that
a parcel of <i>Turks</i> had made an Excursion into the
Enemies Country, and had got great Booty, but
seting no bounds to their Avarice, they, at last
were encountered with a Party of <i>Christians</i>, <i>Dragoons</i>
or <i>Musketeers</i>, who totally routed them,
slew many <i>Sanziacks</i>, and among them his <i>Achillean</i>
Cousin, lately so much extolled by him. This
sad News made <i>Rustan</i> burst out into Tears,
so that his fit of Laughter was justly requited. But
hearken to the close of the Story, which is not unpleasant:
When this <i>Dalmatian</i> Trooper, who
brought the News, was asked by the <i>Bassa</i>, in the
<i>Divan</i>, How many were there of you? He answered,
above two thousand five hundred: And how
many of the <i>Christians</i>? I think, says he, they
were not above five hundred, unless there were more
of them in ambush, as we suspected. Fie for Shame,
said the fretting <i>Bassas</i>! what! a regular Army of
<i>Mussulmans</i> (so they call the Men of their own
Religion) to be beaten by so small a handful of
<i>Christians</i>! You are goodly Warriors indeed! fit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
to eat the <i>Sultan</i>’s Bread, are, you not? The
blunt Fellow, nothing dismay’d, replied, you are
quit beside the Cushion; did I not tell you that we
were beaten by Musketeers? ’Twas the Fire defeated
us, not the Valour of our Enemies. We
had come off Conquerors, if we had contested by
Valour only; but who can fight against Fire, the
fiercest of Elements? and what Mortal can stand,
if the very Elements fight against him? This bold
Answer of his, being as saucily pronounced, made
the By-standers ready to burst out into a Laughter,
though on this sad occasion to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Matter did very much raise my Spirits,
which were quite sunk at the Remembrance of the
former Mis-hap of the Marriage-Feast. This Story
informs us, that our Pistols and Carbines, which
are used on Horseback, are a great Terror to the
<i>Turks</i>, as I hear they are to the <i>Persians</i> also; for
once, there was a Fellow that persuaded <i>Rustan</i>,
when he accompanied his Prince in a War against
<i>Persia</i>, to arm two hundred Horse of his Domesticks
with Pistols: For those, said he, will be terrible to
our Enemy, and will also do great execution upon
them. <i>Rustan</i> hearkned to his Counsel, and furnished
out a Party, as advised; but, before they
had marched half way, their Carbines or Pistols
were ever now and then out of Order; one thing
or other was broke or lost, and scarce any Body
could mend them: Hereupon this Party was useless.
The <i>Turks</i> were also against this Armature,
because it was slovenly (the <i>Turks</i>, you must know,
are much for cleanliness in War); for the Troopers
Hands were black and sooty, their Cloaths full
of Spots, and their Case-boxes that hung by their
Sides made them ridiculous to their Fellow-Soldiers,
who therefore jeered them, with the Title <i>Medicamentarii</i>,
or <i>Mountebank Soldiers</i>; hereupon they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
apply themselves to <i>Rustan</i>, complaining of this
broken, useless Armour, which could do no Service
against an Enemy, and entreating to have their usual
Weapons again, their Bows and Arrows; which,
are readily granted them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mention I made a while ago of things acted
in the Confines of <i>Hungary</i>, gives me occasion to
tell you, what the <i>Turks</i> think of Duels, which amongst
<i>Christians</i> is accounted a singular Proof of
personal Valour. There was one <i>Arslambeg</i>, a
<i>Sanziack</i>, that lived in the Frontiers of <i>Hungary</i>,
who was very much famed for a robust Person;
he was very expert at the Bow; no Man brandished
his Sword with more Strength, or was more terrible
to his Enemy. Not far from him there dwelt one
<i>Uliber</i>, a <i>Sanziack</i> also, who was emulous of the
same Praise; and this Emulation (heighten’d, perhaps,
by other Motives) at length occasioned Hatred
and many bloody Combats between them.
It happened thus, <i>Uliber</i> was sent for to <i>Constantinople</i>;
upon what occasion I know not. When
he came thither, and the <i>Bashaws</i> had asked many
Questions of him, in the <i>Divan</i>, concerning other
Matters, at last they demanded how he and
<i>Arslambeg</i> (<i>Arsla</i> signifies a Lion in <i>Turkey</i>) came to
fall out? Hereupon he makes a long Narration of
the Grudges between them, with their Causes and
Progress; and to put a fairer Gloss on his own
Cause, he added, that once <i>Arslambeg</i> had laid an
Ambush, and wounded him treacherously: And
that, said he, he needed not have done, if he
would have shewed himself worthy the Name he
bears; for I have often challenged him to fight
Hand to Hand, and never shun’d to meet him in
the Field. The <i>Bashaws</i>, much offended, thus
replied, <i>How durst thou challenge thy Fellow-Soldier
to a Duel? What, was there never a <span class="antiqua">Christian</span> to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
fight with? Do not both of you eat your Emperor’s
Bread? And yet, forsooth, you must go about to take
away one another’s Lives! What Precedent had
you for this? Don’t you know, that whoever of the
two had died, the Emperor had lost a Subject?</i>
Whereupon, by their Command, he was haled to
Prison, where he lay pining many Months, and
was, at last, with Difficulty, released; yet with
the loss of his Reputation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Among</span> us <i>Christians</i>, many who have never
come in sight of a public Enemy, draw their
Swords upon one another, and think it a brave
and honourable Thing. What shall a Man do
in such a Case, when Vice usurps the seat of
Virtue, and that which deserves Punishment, is
counted noble and glorious? But to return,
I know you are inquisitive, and therefore give
me leave to acquaint you with the public Entrance,
which the King of <i>Cholchos</i> made into this City.
His Kingdom is by the River <i>Phasis</i>, in a Creek
or Bay of the <i>Euxine</i> Sea, not far from Mount
<i>Caucasus</i>. His Name is <i>Dadianus</i>, a Man of a
tall Stature and grateful Countenance, but of a
rough-hew’n Disposition, as some say. He came
with a great Train, but in a very Thread-bare,
and old-fashion’d Garb. The <i>Italians</i>, at this
Day, call the <i>Colchians Mingrelians</i>: They are
some of that People, inhabiting between the <i>Caspian
Gates</i>, (called by the <i>Turks</i>, <i>Demit capi</i>, i. e.
<i>Iron Gates</i>,) and the <i>Potic</i> and <i>Hyrcanian</i>-Seas:
They are at this Day called <i>Georgians</i>; whether
from that sort of Christian Religion, which they
profess, or whether that be their ancient Name
(which seems most probable,) is not fully determined.
The <i>Albanians</i> and <i>Iberians</i> are reckoned
a Part of them. The Cause of his coming is uncertain:
Some say, he was sent for by the <i>Turk</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
for, when he makes Wars upon the <i>Persian</i>, if
the <i>Colchians</i> and the People of that Tract join
with him, they may give him notable Assistance.
But the vulgar and more credible Opinion was,
that he came to desire the Assistance of some Gallies
against his Neighbour, the <i>Iberian</i>, who had slain
his Father; which if he could obtain, then he
would become Tributary to the <i>Sultan</i>. For, you
must know, that there is an old and inveterate Hatred
between the <i>Colchians</i> and the <i>Iberians</i>. Once
there were some Overtures of Accommodation between
them, and a Conference was had thereupon,
between great Numbers of both Nations.
At this Meeting, they began, first, to try who
should be the greatest Drinkers; in which Contest,
the <i>Colchians</i>, fell fast asleep. The treacherous
<i>Iberians</i> made use of this Opportunity, and hurried
away honest <i>Dadianus</i> as yet snoring, into a Chariot,
and shut him up Prisoner in a high Tower, as if he
had been lawful Prize taken in War. To revenge
this Injury, and to recover their King, the <i>Colchians</i>
levied an Army of 30,000 Men, who were commanded
by the Wife of the captive King, a Woman
of great Spirit, and not unskill’d in Horsemanship,
or handling of Arms. The Commanders,
in this Army, wore huge and unwieldy
Coats of Mail, and were also armed with Swords
and Spears pointed with Iron. They had also amongst
them, a party of Musketeers, a strange
sight in that Country. As for the common Soldiers,
they had no Arms, but Arrows, or Stakes burnt at
one end, or great wooden Clubs. Thus they rode
on Horseback, without Saddle or other Furnture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> rude and discomposed Multitude, drew
near to the Place where their King was in Custody,
but were soon terrified with the Discharge of a few
Guns from the Castle, and ran back a full Mile;
but then taking Heart, on they came again, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
were repulsed with the like Noise as before. <i>Dadianus</i>,
perceiving help so near, cut his Bedcloaths
into a kind of Ropes, and so let himself
down by Night, through his Window, and
fled to his own People. This Stratagem of their
King, and the successful Issue of it, is highly praised
by that People, even to this very day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Country of <i>Colchis</i> abounds with all sorts
of Fruits, growing almost naturally, except Bread-Corn,
Wheat and Barley; and these Grains would
grow there also, if due Tillage were used about
them: But the People are very idle, they only sow
Millet at randum, which yields such an Encrease,
that one Crop serves them for two Years; their
chief Subsistence is thereon, neither desire they any
other Corn. Their Vines grow at the foot of high
Trees, and mounting up to their Boughs, yield
them much Wine, and pretty good. These Vines
last for many Years. Their Bees, like themselves,
live in the Woods, and supply them with Wax
and Honey; all the Pains they take, is, to find
them out. The same Woods yield them plenty
of Venison; as for Pheasants and Partridges, they
abound all over the Country. A great proof of the
Fertility of their Land, are their Melons, which,
besides their extraordinary Sweetness, do oft grow
three Foot long.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for coin’d Silver, they have little or none,
and of Gold less; few of them know what it is:
So that they may seem a very happy People, who
are without so great a Temptation to Mischief.
And yet I think few of us do envy them this Happiness,
because none can grow rich among them;
yet they have that value for Silver, that when they
receive any in Traffick with Foreigners, as some
of them must needs do, they transfer it all to he
use of their Temples, for making Crucifixes, Chalices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
and such like Ornaments, which sometimes
their King, on pretence of Public Necessity, doth
seize upon, and amass it all to his own use.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> only way of Commerce among themselves
is by exchange of Wares. If one have overmuch
of a Commodity, he brings it to Market,
and receives what he wants in Exchange; so that
there is no need of Money, their Commerce is by
bartering of Commodities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> pay also their Tribute to their King in
the Products of the Earth; they supply him with
all Necessaries largely, both for Meat, Drink, and
Apparel, for maintaining of his Houshold, and is
reward the Deserving. And, indeed, he hath an
unexhausted Revenue, not only from Tenths,
and settled Customs, but from those Gifts which
are daily bellowed upon him; and yet he is as
liberal in bellowing them, as he is ready to receive
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> Palace is, as a public Granary, stored with
all manner of Provisions, which are disposed to all
that need, out of his royal Bounty; especially if
that Year’s Harvest hath disappointed the Husbandman.
The Custom is, that if any Merchant
come with his Ship thither, he makes a Present to
the King, either small or great, nothing is refused,
and the King bestows a Banquet on them ashore.
The manner is thus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a large Building, on both sides of
which are the King’s Stables, where a long Table
is plac’d for the King; he himself fits at the upper
end, and, at a moderate Distance, fit the rest.
The Table is well furnished, especially with Venison,
and with Wine enough; the largest Drinkers
are the welcomest Guests. The Queen, with her
female Attendants, hath a Table in the same
Room, but apart by themselves; and then they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
junket freely without much regard to Modesty;
they carry themselves like Anticks, fleering, nodding,
tipping the Wink, like so many <i>Medea’s</i>, if
there were <i>Jasons</i> ready for them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Dinner, the King, with his Guests,
goes a Hunting; and, in Woods, under the Shadow
of large Trees, the common People divert
themselves, and keep Holy-day in Drinking,
Dancing and Singing. They hang their Fiddles
on long Poles or Boards, and then striking them
with a Stick, make Musick, and sing to it the
Praise of their Mistresses, or of their valiant Men.
Among their Heroes (unless I am misinformed)
they often mention one <i>Rowland</i>; how he
came into that Country I know not, unless he
passed thither with <i>Godfrey</i> of <i>Bullogne</i>. They tell
many prodigious Stories of this <i>Rowland</i>, as ridiculous
and improbable as any Romance among
us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> they are thus given to Idleness and Luxury,
Dissoluteness must needs follow; and, to speak
Truth, Chastity is a Virtue rarely found among them.
The Husband will offer his own Wife or his Sister,
to the Pleasure of a Stranger; and, if they can but
thus please their Wives, they care for little else.
Neither are their Daughters kept under any stricter
Discipline. ’Tis hard to find a Damsel unvitiated
among them; nay, some have born Children at
ten Years old; and, if you scruple to believe it,
because of the smallness of their Bodies, at your
Request they will produce you an Infant, not much
bigger than a large Frog. Whereas, otherwise,
they are a tall and comely bodied People. But they
are so void of all Civility and courteous Behaviour,
that they think they pay you a great Compliment,
if among other Barbarities, when they meet you,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
they make a certain Sound from their Throats like
Belching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one thing they shew a great Dexterity of Wit,
and that is in Stealing. He that pilfers most neatly,
is counted a brave Fellow; but he that does
it bungingly, is esteemed a Dunce and a Blockhead,
not worthy to live; and even his own Father
or his Son, will sell or exchange him for a
small Matter to Merchant-strangers, to be carried
away they care not whither.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> <i>Italian</i> Merchant who had been in these
Parts, told me, that a certain Priest of theirs, stole
his Knife as he was in their Temple. He perceived
the Theft, but dissembling it, gave him the Sheath
also, that he might put up his stol’n Ware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> they go into their Temples, they have
some esteem for the Images of the Virgin <i>Mary</i>,
of <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i>, and other Saints; but their
greatest Veneration is for the Image of St. <i>George</i>
on Horseback. They fall down prostrate before it,
kissing every part of it; even his Horse’s Shoes.
They say, he was a valiant Man, a great Warrior,
that in a single Combat did openly fight Hand
to Hand with the <i>Devil</i>, and either conquer’d, or,
at least, foil’d him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I’ll</span> acquaint you with one Passage more, which
you cannot but stand amazed at. ’Tis this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Princes of the East are always presented
with Gifts at any Audience. <i>Dadianus</i>, in compliance
with this Custom, brought <i>Solyman</i> a Cup
or Dish of Carbuncle, so bright and shining, that
in a dark Night a Man might travel by the Light
of it, as well as at Noon-day. I cannot believe
it, you’ll say: Nor do I: Neither can I be angry
with you for suspending your Belief; but, whatever
you and I do, let me tell you, there are enough
that do believe it. The more judicious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
think it to be a small Goblet of <i>Carbuncle</i>, or
<i>Granate</i>, which was lost in Shipwrack, when a
certain Prince of <i>Persia</i> was flying from his Father
to <i>Constantinople</i>, and driven, by a Tempest, to
the <i>Colchian</i> Shore, where it was taken up. He
brought also 20 white <i>Hawks</i>, called <i>Falcons</i>,
there being Plenty of them in that Country of
<i>Colchis</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is all I can inform you of, concerning the
<i>Colchians</i> and their Manners; let me now proceed
to answer your Demands concerning my self, and
my own way of Living. I seldom go abroad, unless
I receive Letters from my Master to be delivered
at the Court; or, unless I am commanded to expostulate
with the <i>Bashaws</i> concerning the Rapines
and Cruelties of the <i>Turkish</i> Garrisons, which is
ordinarily twice or thrice a Year. Perhaps, if I
would desire leave to ride about the City with my
Keeper, it would not be denied me: But I have
no mind to be so much beholding to them; for I
would have them think that the strictness of my
Confinement or Imprisonment is not valued at all
by me; and, to speak Truth, what Comfort can
I have to ride up and down among a parcel of
<i>Turks</i>, who will either slight, or else jeer and reproach
me? No, I like the Country and the Champaign
better than the City; especially that City
which is so full of Ruins, and which retains nothing
of its ancient Glory, besides its Situation.
’Tis true, it was once a Rival to <i>Rome</i> it self;
but now, alas! it is shamefully inslaved; who
can without Pity behold it? Who so hard-hearted,
as not to be affected with the mutability of human
Affairs? And who knows how near we are to the
same Fate? I keep my self within my own Doors,
conversing with my old Friends, I mean, my
Books, in which is all my Delight. ’Tis true, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
my Health’s Sake, I have made a Bowling-Green,
where, before Dinner, I use to play; and,
after Dinner, I practise the <i>Turkish</i> Bow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> are wondrous expert at shooting
with the Bow; they accustom themselves to that
Exercise from 7 or 8, to 18 or 20 Years of
Age, and hereby their Arms grow stronger, and
their Skill so great, that they will hit the smallest
Mark with their Arrows. Their Bows are not
much stronger, but for their shortness much handier
than ours; they are not made of plain Wood,
but of a String and Ox’s Horn, fastened with much
Glew and Flax. These sort of Bows, though
never so strong, the <i>Turks</i>, who are used to the
Sport, can easily draw even to their very Ear;
and yet one that is not accustom’d thereto, though
never so strong a Man, cannot draw to that
height, so as to strike a piece of Money, set upright
between the Bow and the String, in the
Angle where it is put into the Notch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> aim their Arrows so sure, that in a Fight
they will hit a Man’s very Eye, or any other Part
they design to strike. In the place where they exercise,
you may see them direct by their stroke
so artificially, that 5 or 6 of their Arrows will
stick round about the White in the Butt, (which
is usually less than a Dollar) and yet not hurt or
touch it. They stand not above 30 Foot from the
Butt: In the Thumb of their Right Hand, they
use Rings of Bone, on which the String lies, when
they draw it; and with the Thumb of their Left
Hand, they draw the Arrow by a knot bearing
outwards; far otherwise than they do with us.
Their Butt is made of a Bank of sandy, gravelly
Earth, raised about four Foot high from the
Ground, and strongly surrounded with Boards.
But the <i>Bashaws</i>, and those that have great Families,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
train up their Servants in this Exercise, at
their own Houses, where the more skilful teach
the unexperienced. Some of these in their solemn
<i>Bayram</i>, (for they also have their <i>Easter</i>) assemble
themselves together in a great Plain about <i>Pera</i>,
where sitting over-against one another cross-legg’d,
as Taylors do with us, (for that is the manner of
their sitting) they begin with Prayer (so the <i>Turks</i>
begin all their Enterprizes) and then they strive,
who shall shoot an Arrow farthest. The whole
Contest is managed with a great deal of Decency
and Silence, though the number of Spectators be
very great. Their Bows are very short for this
Exercise, and the shorter the better, so that they
are hardly bendable, but by well-practised Persons:
Their Arrows also are of a peculiar kind. He that
conquers hath a Linnen-Handkerchief, such as we
use to wipe off our Sweat, wrought with embroidered
Needle-work, for his Reward; but his greatest
Encouragement, is the Commendation and Renown
he gets. ’Tis almost incredible how far they
will shoot an Arrow; they mark the place, with
a Stone, where the farthest Arrow, for that Year,
was lodg’d. There are many such Stones in the
Field, placed there Time out of Mind, which are
farther than they are able to shoot now a-days, they
say. These were the Marks of their Ancestor’s
Archery, whose Skill and Strength in Shooting,
they acknowledge, they cannot reach to. In divers
Streets and Cross-ways of the City of <i>Constantinople</i>,
there are also such Sports, wherein not only Children
and young Men, but even the graver sort do
exercise themselves. There is one that takes care
of the Butt, who waters it every Day, otherwise
it would be so dry, that an Arrow (the <i>Turkish</i>
Arrows being always blunt) would not stick therein.
And he that thus oversees the Mark is very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
diligent to draw out and to cleanse the Arrows, and
throw them back to the Archers, and he hath a
Stipend from them sufficient to maintain him.
The Front of the Butt is like a little Door,
whence, perhaps, came the <i>Greek</i> Proverb; that,
when a Man miss’d the Mark, he is said to shoot
<i>extra januam</i>, besides the Door; for, I suppose,
the <i>Greeks</i> used this way of Butting, and that the
<i>Turks</i> borrowed it from them. I grant the use of
the Bow is very ancient among the <i>Turks</i>; but
that hinders not, but, when they conquered the
<i>Grecian</i> Cities, they might still retain their way
of butting and bounding their Arrows. For no
Nation scruples to transfer the profitable Inventions
of other Nations to themselves, as I might instance
in <i>Great Ordnance</i>, and in <i>Muskets</i>, and
other things, which, though not our Inventions,
yet the <i>Turks</i> borrow their use of from us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> true, they could never yet be brought to
the Printing of Books, nor to the setting up public
Clocks. The Reasons are, that their Scripture
(<i>i. e.</i>) <i>Alchoran</i>, would no longer be called Scripture,
or Writing, if it were Printed, (that’s their
Fancy); and for Clocks, they suppose, that the
Authority of their <i>Emraim</i>, and of their ancient
Rites would be diminished, if they should permit
the Use of them. In other Cases, they ascribe
much to the ancient Institutions of other Nations,
even almost to the prejudice of their own Religion.
I speak of their Commonalty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Men know how averse they are from the
approving of <i>Christian</i> Rites and Ceremonies;
and, yet, let me tell you, that, whereas the
<i>Greek</i> Priests do use, at Spring-time, a certain way
of Consecration to open the Sea for Sailors (before
which time, they will hardly commit their Vessels
to the Waters) the <i>Turks</i> also observe the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
Ceremony: For, when their Vessels are ready to
sail, they repair to the <i>Grecians</i>, and ask them,
whether they have consecrated the Sea? If they say
<i>No</i>, they desist; if <i>Yea</i>, then they set sail and
away. ’Twas also a Custom of the <i>Greeks</i> not to
open the Pits, in the Isle of <i>Lemnos</i>, for the digging
out of the Earth, called, <i>Agosphragod</i>, before the
Feast of the Transfiguration of our Lord, <i>viz.</i>
<i>August</i> 6. The <i>Turks</i> also observe the same Custom;
and, whereas the <i>Grecian</i> Priests did anciently
celebrate the Liturgy at that time, the
<i>Turks</i> will have them do so still; and they themselves
stand at a distance, as Spectators only: And,
if you ask them, why they do this? Their Answer
is, that there are useful Customs practised of old,
the Causes whereof are not known. The Ancients,
they say, saw and knew more than we; and,
therefore, we will not violate their Customs, lest
we do it to our loss. This Opinion hath so far
prevailed against many of them, that I know
some, who in private will baptize their Children,
alledging, there is some good in that Rite,
and that it was not instituted, at first, without just
Cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> acquainted you thus far with the
<i>Turkish</i> Exercises, let me add one more. They
have a Custom derived from the <i>Parthians</i>, that
they counterfeit flying away on Horseback, and
presently turn back and kill their unwary Pursuers.
The way they learn to do it, is this: They erect
a high Pole, almost in plain Ground, with a
brass Globe on the top of it; about this they spur
their Horses, and having got a little beyond, the
Horse still galloping, they presently turn about,
and flying along, shoot an Arrow into that Globe.
The frequent Use hereof makes them expect,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
that their Bow being turn’d in their Flight, their
unwary Enemy is shot through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> time now, you’ll say, that I return to my
Lodging, lest my Keeper should be angry with
me. Well, then; what time is left me from beholding
these Exercises, I bestow entirely on my
Books, or in Conferences with my Friends the
Citizens of <i>Pera</i>, originally <i>Genoese</i>, or others;
yet not without the leave of my <i>Chiauxes</i>. These
Fellows are not always in the same Humour; they
have their lucid Intervals, in which they are more
tractable than at other times. When ’tis fair Weather
with them, the <i>Ragustæans</i>, the <i>Florentines</i>,
the <i>Venetians</i>, and sometimes the <i>Greeks</i>, with
other Nations, come to visit me, on one Account
or another; sometimes, also, I converse with Men
of more remote Countries, that come hither, whose
Conversation much delights me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> few Months ago, there came hither a Merchant
from <i>Dantzick</i>, who had the sole vending of
Amber. He wondred to what Use the <i>Turks</i> could
put so great a Quantity of it, as they bought; or,
whither they sent it: At last he was told, that they
sent it into <i>Persia</i>, where that kind of Juice, or
Bitumen, is highly esteemed; for they adorn Parlors,
Studies, and Temples with it. He bestowed
upon me, a wooden Vessel full of that Liquor, they
call <i>Juppenbier</i>. It was most excellent Stuff: But
I laughed heartily at my Guests, both <i>Greeks</i> and
<i>Italians</i>, who, not being accustomed to this Liquor,
could not tell what to call it. At length, because
I told them ’twas good to preserve Health, they
thought it was some medicinal Drug, and called it
a <i>Syrup</i>; but they sipp’d and syrupp’d it about so
long, that, at one Dinner, they emptied my Barrel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Liberty my <i>Chiauxes</i> (who now and then are
changed) do sometimes give me. They are not only
willing I should go abroad, but often invite me so
to do: But I, as I told you before, always refuse
them, that so they may not think they can do me
either good or hurt; and the Pretence I make use
of is this, that I have tarried so long at Home,
that now I am grown to the Walls of the House,
so that if I go forth, it would fall. I will not,
therefore, stir abroad, say I, till I go for good and
all into my own Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for my Family, I am glad that they go abroad
sometimes, for thereby they learn to bear the long
Absence from their own Country, the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> yet when they make use of this Liberty,
the drunken <i>Turks</i> often meet and quarrel with
them in the Streets, especially, if no <i>Janizaries</i>
be with them; and, though there be, yet
sometimes Blows happen on both sides: And,
therefore, it is troublesome to me, to excuse my
Domesticks, when they are clamour’d against;
yet, I confess, the surliness and vigilance of my
<i>Chiauxes</i>, in keeping fast my Doors, do in a great
Measure ease me of that troublesome Office. Let
me give you a late Instance of this kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> came lately to me a Messenger from my
Master, the Emperor, one <i>Philip Baldus</i>, an
<i>Italian</i>. He was 66 Years old; and, riding faster
than his Age could bear, he fell into a Fever. My
Physician prescribed him a Clyster, and the same
being brought by the Apothecary, my <i>Chiaux</i>
would not let him in, nor suffer the Medicine to
be brought to the sick Man. Inhumanely enough,
you’ll say; especially, as that <i>Chiaux</i> had carried it
courteously to me for a long time; but now he
was so inraged on a sudden, that ’twas intolerable,
for he threatned to cudgel every body that came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
to me. After he had thus affronted me, I thought
of a way to let him know, how little I valued all
his bug-bear Threats; which was thus. I set one
of my Servants to stand within my Gate, and to
bar it; charging him, to open to none, but at my
Command. The <i>Chiaux</i> comes in the Morning
to unlock the Gate, as his Custom was; but his
Key availed not, for ’twas bolted. On the in-side
he spied my Man, through the Chinks, and calls
out to him to open it. Not I, says he; hereupon the
<i>Chiaux</i> began to be angry, to curse and call Names.
Prate while you will, says my Servant, neither
thy self nor any of thine shall come in here: For
why should I open to thee, more than thou to us?
Thou keepest us shut in, and we’ll keep thee shut
out; do thou shut the Door without, and to be
sure I’ll shut it within. What, says he, did your
Master command you so to do? Yes, said I:
However, says the <i>Chiaux</i>, let me come in and
put my Horse in the Stable: No Stabling for your
Horse here, said he. Let me then have some Hay
and Provender out for him: Not a bit, says he;
go and buy it in the Neighbourhood, there’s enough
to be sold. I used frequently to make the
<i>Chiaux</i> sit down at Meat with me, or else send
him something from my Table; But now the
Case was altered; he stood, fasting as he was, at my
Door, his Horse being tied to a <i>Plane-Tree</i>, over
against it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Bashaws</i>, and other Grandees, as they
passed by that Place in their return from Court,
and knew, by its Trappings, that it was the
<i>Chiaux</i>’s Horse, eating his Hay under the <i>Plane-Tree</i>,
they demanded the Reason, why he was
not shut up in a Stable, as heretofore? He readily
told them all the Matter; that as he shut us up, so
he and his Horse were shut out, so that the one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
could not get Food, or the other Provender.
When the rest of the <i>Bashaws</i> heard this Story, they
laugh’d heartily, and from that Time held it fruitless
to think of terrifying me with such frivolous
Vexations as the shutting my Doors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> a while after that <i>Chiaux</i> was removed,
and then we had more Liberty. <i>Rustan</i> himself
was satisfied how vain his Menaces were by this
Story, I shall now relate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> came a certain aged <i>Sancto</i>, of great
Esteem among them for his Piety, to pay his Court
to him; and, among other Discourses, he asked
<i>Rustan</i> why, since the <i>Sultan</i>’s Children were at
Discord one with another, which was likely to occasion
great Troubles in their Empire, he did not
make Peace with the <i>German</i> Emperor, that <i>Solyman</i>
might be secure from Danger on that side?
I desire nothing more, says <i>Rustan</i>; but how can I
bring it about? His Demands I cannot yield to,
and my Demands he will not accept, nor can I
compel him so to do. I have tried all Ways to
bring him to my Terms; I have kept him in the
nature of a Prisoner these many Years, I have
dealt coarsely enough with him; and yet, alas!
he is but hardened the more thereby. When I
would shut him up as a close Prisoner in his own
House, then he bars his Door on the Inside, that
no body can come at him; thus all my Labour is
in vain. If another Man had been so hardly dealt
with, to avoid the Durance, he would have
turned to our Religion; as for him, he cares not a
Rush.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was <i>Rustan</i>’s Discourse, as some present
thereat informed me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> reason of their surly Carriage, is this:
The <i>Turks</i> are very suspicious, that the Agents
of Christian Princes have a great Latitude in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Commissions; so that they have Power to alter them,
as occasion serves; if they cannot at first get favourable,
then they may except of harder Terms.
To get out of them the full of their Commissions,
they vex their Persons, shut them up close, threaten
War, and abuse them all manner of ways.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> think, that a certain <i>Venetian</i> Resident
did much encourage the <i>Turks</i> to these Courses;
for when the Dispute was between the <i>Venetian</i> and
<i>Turk</i>, about <i>Napoli di Romania</i>, their Agent had a
Charge to try all other ways of Accommodation,
without surrendering the City; but if no milder
Terms would do, then he had Liberty to part with
that City, rather than to engage in a War with the
Port: Some <i>Venetian</i> Traytor declared this part of
his Commission to the <i>Turks</i>, unknown to the Resident
himself; who rather denied that he had any
other Commands, than what he had then proposed,
which were the gentlest Terms. The <i>Bashaws</i>
judging themselves to be deluded, were very angry,
and bid him have a care what he said; their Master
was not to be mock’d; they knew well enough
that he had other Commands, and thereupon,
they recited to him the full of his Commission;
so that now, said they, if you do not tell us,
we shall look on you as a Liar and an Impostor,
and then he would be punished as such; and his Commonwealth
would certainly be ruined, if the implacable
Anger of <i>Solyman</i> did once, on this Occasion,
stir him up to War against him; and, therefore,
speak now, or for ever hereafter hold your
Peace: Our Master will not use Entreaties; he
hath not Power enough, God be thanked, to command
Obedience.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Venetian</i> Agent was so surprized at this
Discourse, which he did not so much as dream of,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
that he very frankly told them all; for which, however,
he was very much blamed in his own Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ever</span> since that time, the <i>Turks</i> have indulged
their Suspicions, that the Christian Agents deal but
partially with them; and, therefore, they must
humble them to get out all the Truth. Upon this
they imprisoned <i>Velduvic</i>, the Emperor <i>Charles</i>’s
Ambassador, 18 Months, and my Collegues more
than three Years, and at last sent them away,
without doing any thing. As for my self, I know
not how long I shall be kept in this Durance; for
my part, I see no end of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Baldus</i>, that ancient Man of whom I
spake before, came to me, they suspected that he
had brought me new Commands, which allowed
me to yield to harder Conditions of Peace; and
they feared that I would conceal them, because I
knew well enough their intestine Discords; so that,
by dealing harshly with me, they thought to extort
the whole Truth from me. Upon the same Design,
<i>Rustan</i> once sent a large Gourd, called by
the <i>Germans Wasser-plutzer</i>. They ripen to a
delicious Sweetness at <i>Constantinople</i>; their Seeds
are red within, and they came originally from
<i>Rhodes</i>. By this Present, sent to me by my Secretary,
<i>Rustan</i> did jestingly insinuate the fear of a
War; it was brought me when the Weather was
very hot, and the Juice is good to cool inward
Heat. He sent this Compliment with it, that I should
make use of the Fruit suitable to the hot Season,
for it is an excellent Cooler; but I should know,
withal, that a great number of those Plants did
grow about <i>Buda</i> and <i>Belgrade</i>, of a much larger
size than that which he sent me, meaning thereby
<i>Cannon-Balls</i>. I returned Thanks for my Present,
and told him, I should make use of it; but, for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
<i>Buda</i> and <i>Belgrade</i>, ’twas no great wonder they
grew there, since there was Plenty of them, even of
a larger size, at <i>Vienna</i>. It was a pleasure to me,
to let <i>Rustan</i> know by my Answer, that I could
retort Quibble for Quibble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return to the Affairs of <i>Bajazet</i>, which
you desired to be further informed in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> may remember that his Father dismissed
him some Years ago, upon this Condition, That
he should never hereafter affront his Brother, nor
raise new Tumults in the Empire, but live
quietly and peaceably, as a Brother ought to do.
He should remember his Promise made to himself,
and not vex him in his old Age; if he did, woe be
to him! These Threats had weight with <i>Bajazet</i>,
as long as his Mother lived; he kept his Word,
rather to retain her good Will and Indulgence towards
him, than as having any Consideration either
for his Brother’s Love or Father’s good Will.
However, quiet he was, for his Mother’s sake: But
two Years after her Death, looking upon himself
as desperate, he cut the Cords of all filial Obedience,
and began to resume his former Designs
against his Brother, and to execute his Animosity
with great spight: Sometimes he laid Ambushes for
his Life; at other times he attempted it by open
force, and now and then he sent Parties of Men
into his Brother’s Province, (their Provinces being
contiguous one to the other) and if he could catch
any of his Domesticks, he used them ill for their
Master’s sake; in fine, he left no Stone unturned,
to lessen his Brother’s Credit, finding he was not
able to reach his Life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span>, he had several Partisans at <i>Constantinople</i>,
who endeavoured to draw over the <i>Grand Seignior</i>’s
Guard to his side; and he did not doubt but,
as his Design ripened, to come privately to <i>Constantinople</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
and there to abscond among his Friends,
till he could have a fair opportunity to make his
appearance in public. <i>Solyman</i> was soon let into
all his Designs, particularly by Letters from his
Son <i>Selimus</i>, who warned him to take care of his
Life; and that, if he did not look upon these Villainous
Attempts of <i>Bajazet</i>, as pointed at himself,
he was much mistaken: For he cared not what he
did either against God or Man, provided he might
gain the Kingdom. Your Life, Sir, said he, is
aimed at as well as mine, and he would wound you
through my sides. His Design was contrived long
ago, but now he only seeks an opportunity to execute
it; and, therefore, pray prevent his Wickedness
before you are circumvented by him too late to find
any Help: As for myself, I can easily bear all his
Injuries; but the greatness of your Danger doth
more nearly concern me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> Informations from <i>Selimus</i> did more and
more incense <i>Solyman</i> against <i>Bajazet</i>; so that he
put him in mind of his Duty, by Letter, telling him
what great Clemency he had used towards him, and
what Promises he had reciprocally made to him.
Call to mind, said he, those Ancient things, ’tis
not so easie for you to get a new Pardon. Leave
off wronging your Brother, and creating trouble to
me. I have but a little time to live; when I am
gone, God will shew which of you shall Reign; in
the mean time, don’t you disturb the public Peace,
nor the Tranquillity of my grey Hairs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> these Expostulations wrought little upon
<i>Bajazet</i>, who was fully determin’d to do his utmost,
rather than to yield his Neck tamely to his Brother’s
Sword; for he saw plainly, that would be his Fate,
if ever <i>Selimus</i> mounted the Throne. However,
he answered his Father’s Letters submissively enough;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
but his Words and his Deeds did not agree, neither
did he drop the prosecution of his intended Design.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Solyman</i> saw this, he resolved to try
another Course, and to remove his two Sons to a
greater Distance one from the other; and, therefore,
he commands each of them, on a prefix’d
Day, to leave his Province (<i>Chiuta</i> was <i>Bajazet</i>’s,
and <i>Magnetia</i> <i>Selimus</i>’s) <i>Bajazet</i> to go to <i>Amasia</i>,
and <i>Selimus</i> to <i>Iconium</i>. This was done, not
out of any disfavour to <i>Selimus</i>, but only to please
<i>Bajazet</i>, lest he should break out into Extremes,
when he was removed from his Government, and
not his Brother from his. Withal, he laid his
Commands on them, that, the more they were severed
by distance of Place, the more they should
be united by Concord of Mind. For (said he) Vicinity
of Habitation doth often breed Discord betwixt
Brethren, and Servants on both sides do ill
Offices to enrage and exasperate the Minds of their
Masters, one against the other; and, therefore, obey
my Commands: Him that refuses, I shall count
a rebellious Son. <i>Selimus</i> immediately left his Province,
as being confident of his Father’s Favour;
but <i>Bajazet</i> made many Hesitations, and when he
was gone a little way he stopt his Journey, complaining
that the unlucky Province of <i>Amasia</i> was
allotted, as a bad Omen to him; because his Brother
was slain there. I should rather, said he, go
to any other Province besides, than where the miserable
End of my Relations will constantly come to
my Mind, and wound my very Soul; and, therefore
he desired his Father to suffer him to winter at least
where he was, or else in his Brother’s Province: But
<i>Solyman</i> would grant neither of those Requests. By this
Time, <i>Selimus</i> was marched with an Army which
was augmented with some Forces from his Father <i>Solyman</i>,
(for they were both afraid of <i>Bajazet</i>’s Plots)<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
against his Brother, who yet made many Halts
and Delays; when, on a sudden, he fetch’d a
compass about, and appeared with his Army on the
Rear of his Brother, going towards <i>Prusias</i>, a City
of <i>Bithynia</i> over against <i>Constantinople</i> on the <i>Asiatic</i>
Shore; his Father gave consent to his March, as
not well pleased with the Delays of <i>Bajazet</i>. For
they thought thus with themselves, that, if <i>Bajazet</i>
could win over the Guards to himself, and march
to <i>Prusias</i>, or even to <i>Constantinople</i> itself, their
Matters, as to <i>Solyman</i> and <i>Selimus</i>, would be in
great hazard; and, therefore, out of a common
fear, ’twas thought most adviseable for <i>Selimus</i> to
stay there, where he might expect most Aid, in case
of Necessity, from the Nearness of the capital Cities.
For <i>Selimus</i> had not yet Forces enough to encounter
his Brother in open Field, with any hopes of
Success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>Bajazet</i> saw his Brother’s Army in his
Rear, and that he got nothing by his Delay, but
the certain Knowledge, that <i>Selimus</i> should Reign
if his Father died, as his Fear added to his Sickness
gave some Likelihood thereof; hereupon, he wrote
Letters to his Father, wherein he laid grievous
Things to the Charge of his Brother <i>Selimus</i>, as,
that his present March did plainly declare, what a
wicked Intent he had towards his Father, who was
come so near the <i>Metropolis</i>, that he might treacherously
compass the Empire, and that he might have
but a short Passage over, if his Father died. But, if
his Father’s Life should balk his desire, then he
would suborn some Parricide or other to take it
away; and yet, this is the Son, forsooth, said he,
that you have in your Bosom; as if he were a very
Nonsuch for filial Obedience; whereas I, who
never entertained a bad Thought against you in all
my Life, but was always observant of your very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
Becks, am rejected and call out of Favour; and
yet the Sum of my Demands is only this, that an
unlucky Province may not be designed for my
Government; either that which my Brother left,
or any other more fortunate one than that of <i>Amasia</i>;
and, says he, I shall expect an Answer in the Place
where I now abide, lest, if my Suit be granted, I
be forced to march a great way back; but if your
Ears be deaf to my Request, then I will march to
what Province you shall command me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the truth is, <i>Bajazet</i> had reason to be averse
from <i>Amasia</i>; for ’tis a Custom among them to build
much on Auguries and ill Omens, even in the
smallest Matters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> these Letters were otherwise understood by
<i>Solyman</i>, who was well acquainted with his Son’s
Fears, and knew that he affected a Government not
so remote, but nearer to <i>Constantinople</i>, that thereby
he might have the better opportunity for Innovations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> <i>Bajazet</i> made one Excuse after another
for his Delay, and seemed to retard his Father’s
Pleasure; he listed Soldiers, increased his Army,
rais’d Money, and provided all things necessary for
his own Defence, and the Conquest of his Brother.
<i>Solyman</i> looked upon his Design as against himself,
yet the crafty old Man dissembled it what he could;
for he was unwilling to make <i>Bajazet</i> quite desperate.
He was now grieved that the Eyes of all
Nations were fix’d on that Dissention between his
Sons, and therefore he design’d to use some Delay,
that the Matter, if possible, might be composed
with as little Noise as possible. He answered <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Letters mildly, telling him, that, as for the
Change of Provinces, he was fully resolved to be
obey’d therein; and, therefore, he and his Brother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
would do well immediately to repair to their respective
Armies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for other Concerns, he need not take care of
them, for he himself would so order Matters, that
neither his Brother nor he should have any Cause
to complain. <i>Solyman</i> chose <i>Pertau</i>, the Fourth
Vizier <i>Bashaw</i>, to carry those Letters to <i>Bajazet</i>;
and, that he might seem to deal impartially between
them both, he sent <i>Mehemet</i>, the third Vizier
<i>Bashaw</i>, to <i>Selimus</i>. He also laid a Charge on
both those <i>Bashaws</i>, not to stir a step from either
of his Sons, till they had both entred on their respective
Governments. This was wisely done by
<i>Solyman</i> to leave such faithful Moniters with his
Children, which would daily put them in Mind of
their Duties.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accordingly</span>, <i>Selimus</i> did willingly admit
his Father’s <i>Bashaw</i>; but <i>Bajazet</i>, whose Mind was
wholly set upon imbroiling the State, could not
endure to have one of his Father’s Counsellors obtruded
upon him, to be a Witness of his Designs,
and to be a Tell-tale to his Father. And, therefore,
he dismissed the <i>Bashaw</i>, who was willing to
have staid, having first courteously treated and presented
him with Gifts, according to his present
Ability; and he did it with this Pretence, that he
had none else to represent his Cause impartially to
his Father, but only himself; and, if he would do
him so good Offices, he promised not to be ungrateful
to him. He desir’d him also to tell his Father,
that his Commands should always be to him as a
Law, but that he was forced to do what he did,
for fear of his Brother <i>Selimus</i>, whose Injuries and
Affronts he could no longer endure. By this Message
of <i>Pertau</i>, <i>Solyman</i> was assured of <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Design, though, to colour the Matter, and to put
a Blind on his Father’s Embassy, he pretended he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
would hasten to <i>Amasia</i>. However, <i>Solyman</i> was
not slow in his Preparations against <i>Bajazet</i>, for he
commanded the <i>Beglerbeg</i> of <i>Asia</i>, though sick of
the Gout, to assist his Son <i>Selimus</i> with a Body of
Horse; and he sent also the most faithful of his
Guards to accompany <i>Mehemet Bassa</i>, (who was
also returned from his Embassies) into <i>Asia</i> on the
same Errand; and he himself pretended he would
gird on his Sword and follow them. But, alas!
the Guards shew’d themselves very unwilling to the
Service; for they abominated the War betwixt
Brothers, as an impious Thing. For against whom
should they draw their Sword? Was not <i>Bajazet</i>
Heir of the Crown too? This unnecessary Discussion
(said they) may be compass’d without Blood;
neither are we to be forc’d to sheath our Swords in
one another’s Bowels: As for <i>Bajazet</i>, he is forced
to do what he doth, in a way of Self-preservation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> these Rumours came to <i>Solyman</i>’s Ears,
he sent for the <i>Mufti</i> (the High-Priest of the <i>Turks</i>,
from whom, as from an Oracle, they expect Answers
to their Doubts) and puts a Case to him in
these Terms.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">How</span> ought that Man to be dealt with, who
durst disturb the Peace of the Empire, by taking
Towns, and raising Men and Money, while he
was alive? As also, What he thought of those,
who were assistant to him in that Design, and
fought under his Ensigns? and, lastly, what was
to be done with those who refused to engage against
him, but rather justified his Practises?”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Mufti</i>’s Answer was, “That such a Person
with all his Followers were worthy of Death;
and they that refused to Fight against him were
to be abominated, as Prophane, and Deserters of
their Religion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Answer was divulged among the Commonalty,
and by the Chief of the <i>Chiauxes</i> was
transmitted to <i>Bajazet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> while after there came a <i>Chiaux</i> to <i>Constantinople</i>,
who had been sent by <i>Solyman</i> to <i>Selimus</i>, but
had been intercepted by <i>Bajazet</i>; by whom he sent
a Message to their Father, to this effect; that he
would never fail in expressing his Duty to his Father,
and that he never took up Arms against him, but
was resolved to be obedient to him in all Things.
The Dispute was only between his Brother and
himself, who sought his Life, so that he must fall
by his Brother’s Sword, or his Brother by his.
This difference might be decided in his Father’s Life;
and, therefore, he desired him not to interpose or
assist his Brother, but to carry himself in an exact
Neutrality; but if (said he) you pass over into <i>Asia</i>,
(as Report says you will) to assist <i>Selimus</i>, don’t
think I shall be speedily reduced, for I know whither
to retreat; and, let me tell you, the first Day
you set Foot in <i>Asia</i>, I will destroy all by Fire and
Sword, and make it as desolate, as <i>Tamerlane</i>, or
any of our fiercest Enemies, ever did.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> this Message was delivered to <i>Solyman</i>,
it did much disturb him, especially when Word was
brought to him, that the Town of <i>Axuar</i>, which
<i>Selimus</i>, his Son, was <i>Sanziach</i> of, was taken by
<i>Bajazet</i>; who, after he had exacted a great Sum of
Money from the Inhabitants, plundered and sack’d
it shamefully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>Selimus</i>, when he heard that his Brother
march’d towards <i>Amasia</i>, and was already come as
far as <i>Ancyra</i>, being now freed from the Suspicion
of Treachery, which he fear’d in his March, hastened
towards <i>Iconium</i>, where a Garrison was kept for
his Arrival.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Twas</span> none of the least of <i>Solyman</i>’s Cares,
which distracted his Mind, lest <i>Bajazet</i> should seize
on <i>Iconium</i>, and so march into <i>Syria</i>, from whence
there is a large Passage into <i>Egypt</i>, a Province not
fully settled in Subjection to the <i>Turks</i>, and somewhat
mindful of the ancient Governors of the <i>Circassians</i>
or <i>Mamalukes</i>, longed for a Change. And
if <i>Bajazet</i> once got thither, he foresaw it would
be a very hard Matter to beat him out, should the
neighbouring <i>Arabians</i> assist him; who, in hopes
of Booty, were ready to take any side. And if,
with much ado, he could have been driven out
of <i>Egypt</i>, yet from thence he might easily be
wafted over into any of the <i>Christian</i> Countries;
whereupon <i>Solyman</i>, by all means, sought to stop
his March thither, because he thought it would be
<i>Bajazet</i>’s last Shift; and to that end he had written
to most of the Governors of lesser <i>Asia</i>, to be watchful,
ever and to assist <i>Selimus</i>, when he called for
their Aid. Accordingly <i>Selimus</i> formed a Camp
before the Walls of <i>Iconium</i>: For he thought it
best to wait there for the Auxiliaries of his Father,
and not to hazard his All on the doubtful Issue
of a Battel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the other side, <i>Bajazet</i>, knowing what a hazardous
Enterprize he had undertaken, was as vigorous
to support his Cause. He hired a great
body of Horse, called <i>Chiurts</i>, perhaps formerly
<i>Gordianes</i>, Men noted for Valour, in whom he
put Confidence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span>, as soon as ever they came to this Army,
began their Representation of a Battel on Horseback,
which had so much of Reality in it, that
many of them were slain, but more wounded.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> Camp was pitch’d in the plain and open
Fields of <i>Ancyra</i>, from which City he was supplied
with many Necessaries; and at the Castle thereof<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
he placed his Concubines and Children. From
those Merchants, that were rich, he borrowed
Money, upon Terms of Re-payment with Interest,
if God gave him Success. From thence,
also, he was furnished with Arms for his Soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span> his own Family (consisting of very
many among the higher sort of <i>Turks</i>) and the
<i>Chiurts</i> before-mentioned, those that were of his
Mother’s, or his Sister’s, or of <i>Rustan</i>’s Faction,
came in to him; so did very many of <i>Mustapha</i>’s
and <i>Achmet</i>’s Favourites, fierce and skilful Warriors;
for they grudging at the undeserved Deaths
of their Masters; were resolved to revenge them
with the hazard of their Blood: some also came under
his Banner out of Commiseration of the depressed
Condition of <i>Bajazet</i>, as being necessitated
to fly to Arms, his last and only Refuge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> great many favoured <i>Bajazet</i>, because he was
like his Father; whereas <i>Selimus</i> had not one
Feature in his Face resembling him. ’Tis true,
he was very like his Mother, a Woman hated
while she was alive. He was a big-bellied Man,
with swoln Cheeks, and his Face of a deep and
uncomely Redness; insomuch, that the Soldiers
would seemingly say, <i>He was cramm’d with Barley-Pudding</i>.
Besides, he liv’d a slothful, banquetting,
idle Life; neither was he courteous,
or of easy Access, nor did he oblige by any act of
Generosity. The Reason he gave, was, that he
would not offend his Father, by aiming at popular
Applause. Thus he became dear to his Father
only, but odious to every body else; yea, those
Persons did most disdain him, who coveted a munificent
and an active Emperor. The same Soldiers
that were wont to call <i>Bajazet</i>, <i>Softi</i> (a sedentary
Man, and given up to his Studies) when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
they saw that he took up Arms, and ventured his
All to defend himself and his Children, now extolled
him to the Skies, as a Man of extraordinary
Valour. Why (said they, reasoning among themselves)
should his Father abdicate a Son that is his
express Image? Why should he prefer his slothful,
pot-bellied Brother, that has nothing of his Father’s
Disposition in him? As for <i>Bajazet</i>’s taking
Arms, Necessity forces him to it, and therefore,
he is not to be blamed; for did not <i>Selimus</i>,
his Grandfather, do the same? What great Precedent
could there be? For he did not only arm against
his Brother, but Necessity also compelled
him to hasten his Father’s Death; and yet by this
Procedure he established the Kingdom to himself
and his Posterity. Now, if <i>Solyman</i> did rightfully
possess that Kingdom, so gotten, why should his
Son be denied to take the same Course? Why
should that Fact be thought so heinous in him,
which was accounted lawful in his Grandfather?
And yet the Case is much different (said they); for
<i>Bajazet</i> did not take up Arms against his Father,
but wishes him a long Life; nay, he would not
hurt an Hair of his Brother’s Head, if he could
be sure of his own Life, against him: But ’tis always
lawful to resist Force by Force, and, if possible,
to prevent one’s own certain Ruin. These
Discourses caused many to fly to <i>Bajazet</i>, and
his Army being now of a moderate Size, without
delay, he marches towards his Brother, putting his
Life, Fortune, and the hope of his Empire, upon
the Event of the Battel; for thus, thought he, my
Valour (at least) will be commended, if it be not
prosperous; I will endeavour if I can, to break
my way into <i>Syria</i>, and, if I succeed therein, my
Business is done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Selimus</i></span> waited for him under the Walls of <i>Iconium</i>,
having a vast Army, encreased by Forces
sent him from his Father, and well furnished with
skilful Commanders; and, besides all other Necessaries,
secured with great Ordnance on every side.
<i>Bajazet</i> was nothing terrified at all those Disadvantages,
but as soon as he came in sight of his Brother’s Army,
he exhorted his Own, though inferior
in Number, in this manner.</p>

<p><i>Now, <span class="antiqua">says he</span>, the long wished for Hour is
come, wherein you may shew your Valour; do you
act as Men, and let me alone to reward you. All
my Fortune is in your Hands; my Misfortunes have
been irksome some time, but now here is an open
Campaign, wherein I may change them for the
better, and forget all the Miseries of my former
Life. If you conquer, you may expect from me
Honour, Dignity, and all kinds of Rewards, befitting
Men of Valour. One Victory will crown
all our Hopes, though never so vast, and that you
may get by your superabounding Valour. As for
my Brother’s Troops before your Eyes, they are a
Company of <span class="antiqua">Buffoons</span> under a slothful General;
you may easily make way through them with your
Swords; what Forces he hath with him of my Father’s,
though they are his in Body, yet they are mine
at Heart. ’Tis <span class="antiqua">Selimus</span> alone that stands in the
way, both of my Vassals, and of your Happiness too,
and therefore, let us both revenge our selves on a
common Enemy. And for their Multitude, don’t
fear them; Conquest is got by Valour, not by Number.
God Almighty uses to assist the <span class="antiqua">Best</span>, not the
<span class="antiqua">Most</span>. Certainly, if you consider how the savage
Enemy thirsts after your Blood, you will preserve
yours, by shedding theirs. In fine, <span class="antiqua">said he</span>, I will
not only speak, but do. Let me be your Pattern.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
Do you fight but as valiantly for my Safety, as
I shall do for your Advancement, and I’ll warrant
you the Battel is our own.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> finished his Oration, he made towards
the Enemy with an undaunted Courage, and in
the Front of his Army shew’d himself both a brave
Soldier and a skilful Commander, so that he was
renowned also by his very Enemies. The Battel
was bloody, and many fell on both Sides, and
Victory seem’d to hover with doubtful Wings;
but at last she inclin’d to that side, where was
more Force, a juster Cause, and better Counsel.
Just in the nick, there arose such a Wind that it
carried the smoke of the Ordnance into the very
Faces of <i>Bajazet</i>’s Army, so that they fought
blindfold, as it were; whereupon <i>Bajazet</i>, after
much Blood-shed on both sides, was forced to sound
a Retreat; but he made it with so little Disorder,
and so leisurely, that he seemed a Conqueror, rather
than to have lost the Day. Neither did <i>Selimus</i>
move out of his Camp to pursue him, being well
contented to see his Enemies turn their Backs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> this, <i>Bajazet</i>, considering he had disobeyed
his Father’s Commands, by indulging his
own Humour, and being cut off from his March
into <i>Syria</i>, which he had design’d, resolved to move
in good earnest towards <i>Amasia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Solyman</i></span> had presently a Messenger sent him of
this Victory, and immediately he posted over into
<i>Asia</i>. His <i>Bashaws</i> would not let him go before;
<i>But now</i> (said they) <i>you must make haste to press
upon <span class="antiqua">Bajazet</span> in his Misfortune and to prevent his
Recruit; for if his secret Favourites should declare
for him, they might cut them out further Work.
The Report of your Passage over, will both discourage
your Son and terrify all his Followers; and, therefore,
make haste, lest he serve you as sometime your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
Father did, who was more formidable after he was
conquered than before, so that his very Overthrow
at first was the cause of his Victory in the End.</i>
Neither did they thus speak without Cause; for
’tis incredible how much that Fight, though unfortunate,
had added to <i>Bajazet</i>’s Renown. That
he was so hardily valorous, as, with a small
handful in comparison, to set upon the well-disciplin’d
Army of his Brother, strengthened too
with his Father’s Forces; that he was not daunted
with the disadvantage of the Place, nor the roaring
of the great Ordnance, and that he carried himself
in the very Battel, not as a raw Officer, but an
expert General. ’Tis true, said they, his Success
was not answerable, but his Valour was not inferior;
and, therefore, let <i>Selimus</i> boast never so
much of his Victory to his Father, this we are sure
of, that, of the two, <i>Bajazet</i> deserved to be Conqueror;
and that we may attribute his Brother’s
being so to any thing rather than to his own Valour.
These Discourses concerning <i>Bajazet</i>,
shew’d him to be Popular, and thereupon they
double his Father’s Grief and Pain, and his Desire
to ruin him. Resolved he was, none but <i>Selimus</i>
should succeed him in the Empire: For, besides
that he was his eldest Son, he had been always
faithful and obedient to him; but <i>Bajazet</i> had been
rebellious, and gaped after the Throne in his Lifetime;
and he feared him the more, because he
was esteem’d a very valiant Prince, and because
also he had openly assisted <i>Selimus</i> against him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> these Reasons he pass’d the Sea into <i>Asia</i>,
but with a Resolution not to stir from the Shore,
but to assist his Son <i>Selimus</i>’s Affairs, only at a
distance. For why, thought he, should I run
any Hazard to bring my own Forces nearer, lest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
my Army, not fully settled in their Obedience,
should be tempted to a Revolt.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> my self saw <i>Solyman</i> march out of <i>Constantinople</i>
in the Year 1559, <i>June 5th</i>, tho’ against the
Will of my <i>Chiaux</i>. Let me here present you
with a Scene of Mirth, and like a Braggadocio-soldier,
tell you of two Battels I had at once; for
why, I have Leisure enough (unless you count my
Cares my Study) and the larger I am in my Scribling,
the more time do I borrow from my Troubles.
Hear then, what were my Quarrels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was certainly inform’d that the <i>Sultan</i>
was ready to pass over into <i>Asia</i>, and that the Day
was fix’d for his Departure, I told my <i>Chiaux</i>
that I had a mind to see him march out, and therefore
he should come betimes in the Morning and
open the Doors, for he used to carry the Keys of
my Doors home with him at Night; he promised
me courteously, he would do so. Then I order’d
my <i>Janizaries</i> and my Interpreters, to take
me an upper Room in the way the Emperor was
to pass, convenient for my View: They obeyed
my Commands. When the Day was come, I rose
before ’twas light, and expected that my <i>Chiaux</i>
had opened my Doors; but finding them shut,
I sent several Messengers to him, to come and let
me out, both my <i>Janizaries</i> that waited within
Doors, and <i>Druggermen</i> that waited to come in:
This I did, through the Chinks of the Gate, which
was very old; but the <i>Chiaux</i> still spun Delays,
pretending he would come presently. Thus I spent
some time, till I heard the noise of the Guns,
which the <i>Janizaries</i> use to fire, when their Emperor
takes Horse; then I began to fret and fume,
seeing my self so deluded. My Disappointment and
just Indignation did affect the <i>Janizaries</i> themselves:
they told me, that if my People would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
thrust hard with them, they without would so press
upon the Valves, which were loose and old, that
the Bars would fall out. I took their Counsel; the
Doors flew open accordingly, and out we went,
hastening to the Room I had hired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> <i>Chiaux</i> had a mind to frustrate my Desire,
and yet he was no bad Man neither; for having communicated
my Request to the <i>Bashaws</i>, they were
not willing that any Christian should behold their
Prince marching with so small Force against his own
Son, and therefore, said they to him, do you promise
him fair, but be sure to delay him till the <i>Sultan</i>
is a Shipboard; then you may think of some
Excuse or other to bring you off.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I came to the House where a Room was
hired for me, the Door was shut, so that I could
no more enter into that, than I could go out of my
own; when I knock’d, no body answered. Hereupon
the <i>Janizaries</i> again told me, that, if I commanded
them, they would either break open the
Doors, or get in at Window and open them. I
told them, they should not break open any thing;
but if they would go up to the Windows, they
might: they presently did so, and opened the Door.
When I went up Stairs, I found the House full of
<i>Jews</i>, a whole <i>Synagogue</i> of them. They looked
upon it as a Miracle, that I should enter, when
the Doors were shut; but being informed of the
Truth, an old grave Matron, in comely Habit,
address’d herself, and complained to me, in <i>Spanish</i>,
of the Violence I had offered to the House; I told
her, she had done me wrong, in not keeping her
Word, and that I was not a Man to be thus deluded;
she seem’d dissatisfied, and the Time would not
admit of further Discourse. In short, I was allowed
one Window, which on the back side looked out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
into the Street, and from thence, with a great deal
of Pleasure, I saw all the grand Procession.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Gulupagi</i> and <i>Ulufagi</i> marched two by two;
the <i>Selchers</i> one by one, and <i>Spahi’s</i> (which are the
Names of the <i>Grand Seignior</i>’s Horse-Guards) distinguished
by their Ranks and Troops; they were
about 6000, besides a vast number of the Domesticks
of the Prime <i>Vizier</i>, and of other <i>Bashaws</i>. The
<i>Turkish</i> Horsemen make a gallant Show; the best
Breed of Horses is from <i>Cappadocia</i> and <i>Syria</i>, and
the adjacent Countries; he is set out with Silver
Trappings, studded with Gold and Jewels. His
Rider is clad with a Coat or Vest made of Silk
Velvet, or other fine Cloth of Scarlet, Purple or
dark blue Colour, intermixed with Gold and Silver.
He hath two Cases hanging by his sides, one holds
his Bow, the other his Arrows, both of neat <i>Babylonian</i>
Workmanship; and so is his Buckler which he
bears on his Left Arm, and is Proof against Arrows,
Clubs, or Swords. In his Right Hand, unless he
desire to have it free, he carries a light Spear, for
the most part painted with Green. His Scimiter
is studded with Jewels, and made of steel, and it
hangs down from his Saddle. What need so much
Armour, say you? I’ll tell you. They use them
all; and that dextrously too. You’ll reply, how
can he use that Spear and the Bow too? What!
will he take up his Spear when he hath broken, or
thrown away, his Bow? Not so neither; for he
keeps his Spear, as long as he can: But, when he
hath occasion to use his Bow, the Spear, being
light and easily manag’d, he puts between his Saddle
and his Thigh; so that the Point of it sticks
out backward; and thus he presses it down with
his Knee, as long as he pleases. But, if he fights
only with the Spear, then he puts up his Bow into
his Case, or else with his left Hand places it behind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
his Shield. It is not however my present Design
to acquaint you with the <i>Turks</i> Expertness at Arms;
they have obtain’d it by long Use and Experience in
War. Their Heads are covered with very fine
white Cotton-Linnen, in the midst whereof stands
up a Tuft made of Purple Silk, plaighted; some of
them wear black Feathers a-top.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> the Horse, a large Body of <i>Janizaries</i>
followed, being Foot, and seldom taking any other
Arms than Muskets. The Make and Colour of
their Cloaths are almost the same, so that you would
judge them all to be the Servants of one Man.
They have no ungainly Habit among them, nor
any thing rent or torn; their Cloaths will wear out
soon enough, they say, without their tearing them;
yet, in their Feathers, Crests, and such-like military
Ornaments, they are over-curious, or rather proud;
especially, the <i>Veterans</i> in the Rear, you would
think a whole Wood of walking Feathers were in
their Fire-stars and Frontals; after them their
Officer and Commanders follow on Horseback,
distinguished each by his proper Ensign. In the
last Place marches their <i>Aga</i>, or General. Then
succeed the chief Courtiers, amongst whom are the
<i>Bashaws</i>; then the Foot of their Prince’s Life-Guard
in a particular Habit, carrying their Bows
bent in their Hands, for they are all Archers; next
the Prince’s Led-Horses, all with curious Trappings.
He himself rode on a stately Prancer, looking sour,
with his Brows bent, as if he had been angry; behind
him came three Youths, one carrying a Flagon
of Water, another his Cloak, another his
Bow. Then followed some Eunuchs of the Bed-Chamber;
and, at last, a Troop of about Two
Hundred Horse closed the Procession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> I had the Satisfaction of viewing all this,
my only care was now to appease my Hostess, she
that at my entrance spake to me in <i>Spanish</i>, for I
heard she was very familiar with <i>Rustan</i>’s Wife,
and therefore I was afraid she would represent things
unhandsomely against me; to prevent which, I sent
for her, and told her she should have remembered her
Bargain, and not have shut her Door against me
who had hired a Room; but, though you, said I,
don’t remember your Promise, I’ll perform mine;
yea, I will be better than my word: I promis’d you
but seven Pistoles, but here’s ten for you, that so
you may not repent your Admittance of me into
your House. When the Woman thus unexpectedly
saw her Hand fill’d with Gold, she was presently
melted down into a Compliance, and the
whole Synagogue of them fell to Compliments and
giving me thanks; and the Woman that was Crony
to <i>Rustan</i>’s Wife, made one in the Consort, for
she always, in my Landlady’s name, gave me great
Thanks. They offered me <i>Grecian</i> Wine and a
Banquet, which I refused, but with great Acclamations
of all the <i>Jews</i>, made haste to be gone,
that I might manage a new Dispute with my <i>Chiaux</i>,
for keeping my Doors fasten’d, when I should
have come forth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> found him sitting mournfully in my Porch,
where he began a long Complaint, that I ought
not to have gone abroad without his Consent, nor
have broke open the Door: that I had violated
the Law of Nations thereby, and such like stuff.
I replied, in short, that, if he had come betimes in
the Morning as he promised, he had prevented all
this; his breach of Promise had occasioned it, for
his Intent was only to deceive me. I demanded
also of him, whether he look’d upon me as an Ambassador,
or a Prisoner? As an Ambassador, says<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
he. If you think me a Prisoner, said I, then I am
not an fit Instrument to make a Peace, for a Prisoner
is not his own Man; but if an Ambassador, as
you confess, then why am I not a Free-man?
Why can’t I go abroad when I will? Captives use to
be shut up, not Ambassadors: Liberty is granted to
such in all Nations; they may claim it as their publick
due: He ought to know, that he was not appointed
to be my Serjeant, or Keeper, but to assist
me, (as he himself used to say) with his good Offices,
that so no other Man might do any Injury to
me or mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hereupon</span> he turns to the <i>Janizaries</i>, and
quarrels with them, for giving me Advice, and helping
my Servants, to break open the Doors. They
said, I had no need of their Advice: I commanded
them to open them, and they obeyed; there was
no great Difficulty in it, the Doors were old, and
flew open presently; there was nothing either lost
or broken. Thus the <i>Chiaux</i> was forced to hold his
Peace, and I never heard any more of the matter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> while after, I had also leave to pass over the Sea,
for the <i>Turks</i> judged it conducing to their Affairs, to
treat me nobly in their Camp, as the Ambassador of
a Prince in Alliance with them; and to that end, I
had a handsome Lodging provided for me near their
Camp, where I had all the Conveniences imaginable.
I lived there three Months, and had the opportunity
to view the Camp of the <i>Turks</i>, which was extended
all over the neighbouring Fields, and to discover
some parts of their Discipline: You will not find
fault with me, if I acquaint you with something
thereof. Know then, that I cloathed myself as
<i>Christians</i> do in that Country, and with one or two
Attendants walked up and down their Camp <i>incognito</i>.
The first thing I saw, was, the Soldiers of
each Body quartered with great Order in their several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Ranks, and that with a great deal of Silence, (’tis
far otherwise in <i>Christian</i> Camps) all hush; not a
Quarrel, nor the least Disorder or Noise amongst
them in their Jollities. Besides, they are wonderfully
cleanly; no Dung-hill or Noisom smell to
offend the Eye or Ear; all their Ordure they bury
under Ground, or throw it far enough off. When
they have occasion to ease Nature, they dig a Pit
with a Spade, and there bury their Excrements; so
that there is no ill smell at all. Besides, there are
no Drinking-matches amongst them, no playing
with Cards or Dice, (the Bane of the <i>Christian</i> Army!)
I only heard one <i>Hungarian</i> common Soldier
playing a doleful Ditty on a ill-tuned Harp,
and his Companions were howling rather than singing
to it; it was the last Words of a Fellow-Soldier,
who died of his Wounds on the grassy Bank of the
<i>Danow</i>; he adjured that River, as her Streams were
gliding to his own Country, to commend him to
his Friends there, and tell them that he died no ignoble,
nor unrevenged Death for the glory of their
Nation, and encrease of their Religion. His Fellows
groaned out, <i>Thrice happy he! O that our Case
were like his!</i> For you must know, the <i>Turks</i> are
of opinion, That no Souls go more directly to Heaven,
than those of valiant Men, who lost their lives
in the Field; and that Virgins do pour out daily
Prayers to God for their Safety.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> had a mind to pass through the Shambles, that I
might see what Flesh was sold there; I saw only four
or five Weathers at most, hung up dress’d; they were
the Shambles of the <i>Janizaries</i>, who were at least
4000. I wondred so little Flesh could suffice so many;
and was answered, They used but little Flesh,
but great part of their Diet was brought from <i>Constantinople</i>.
When I demanded, <i>What that was</i>,
they shewed me a <i>Janizary</i> near at hand, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
lying down, and boiling Turnips, Leeks, Garlick,
Parsnips, and Cucumbers. He seasoned them with
Salt and Vinegar, and, Hunger being his best Sauce,
eat them as heartily, as if they had been Partridge
or Pheasant.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> Drink was that which is common to all
Animals, <i>viz.</i> <i>Water</i>; by this frugality, they consult
the Health of their Bodies, and also the saving
of their Money. And the very time wherein they
did this, caused me to admire the more; it was their
Fast, (or, as we call it, <i>Lent</i>) at which time among
<i>Christians</i>, even in well-govern’d Cities, as well as
in Camps, there is nothing but Sporting, Dancing,
Singing, Revelling, Drunkenness, and such like
Madness; insomuch, that a <i>Turkish</i> Envoy coming
once, at that time of the Year, reported at his return,
That the <i>Christians</i> at certain times grew mad
and raging, but sprinkling themselves with a sort of
Ashes in their Temples, they recovered their Wits
again, so that they did not seem the same Men;
thereby denoting <i>Ash-Wednesday</i>, and its Eve. The
<i>Turks</i>, hearing this, were struck with a great Amazement,
because they have many Medicines amongst
them which cause Madness, but very few
that procure a speedy recovery from it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the Days immediately preceding their Fasts,
they do not alter their private way of living in their
Worshipping; rather on the contrary, they abridge
themselves of some of their daily Commons, that
they may prepare for their Fasts, lest a sudden Abstinence
might be prejudicial to their Healths.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> time of their Fast is so appointed, that every
Year it comes fifteen Days sooner than the former;
the reason is, because they fill not the twelve
yearly spaces of the Moon: Hence it comes to pass,
that their Fast kept in the early Spring, after six
Years, happens at the beginning of Summer; for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
they measure their Fasts by the course of the Moon,
and there are none more irksom to them, than those
which fall out in the long Summer-days; for, while
they Fast, not a bit, nor so much as a drop of Water,
goes down (neither dare they so much as wash their
Mouths therewith) before the Star appear in the Evening,
the longest Day of Abstinence, being hot,
and of course dusty, must needs be very tedious, especially
to the poorer sort, who live by their Labour:
Yet, before Sun-rise (though not after) while yet the
Stars shine in the Firmament, it is lawful for them
to eat; and therefore they better endure their Winter
Fasts. And that they may not be deceived by
the darkness of the Weather, their Priests hang out
Lights in Paper-Lanthorns from the top of their
<i>Mosque</i>, (from whence they are wont, by sound of
Voice to call them to the Prayers, as we do by Bells):
And this shews that their Eating-time is come;
whereupon entring presently into their Temples, and
worshipping God in their way, they return to Supper.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the close of their Summer-Falls, I once saw
a great many of them go into a Tavern over-against
my Lodging, (where Ice from Mount <i>Olympus</i> in
<i>Asia</i> was always to be sold) and there they ask’d
for Icy water, which they drank jetting strangely
backwards; for the <i>Turks</i> count it profane either to
Eat, Drink or Piss in a standing posture, unless in
case of Necessity; but they do it bending their Bodies,
as Women do with us when they make Water.
And whereas in the dusk of the Evening I
could not well discern the meaning of that Posture,
I was told that most of them drank a draught of
cold Water, to make way for their Meat, for otherwise
it would stick to their Jaws and they could not
swallow it; and, besides, this moisture of their Palate
did quicken their Appetites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> their Diet they are not choice, and after
their Fasts they may eat any Meat which was
lawful for them to do at other Times. If they
fall sick, they omit their Fasts, but with this condition,
that when they recover they must fast so
many Days over, as they neglected before. But
when they are near an Enemy, and ready to fight,
lest Fasting should weaken their Bodies, they are
allowed to eat; and if a blind Superstition restrains
some of them, then their Emperor, at Noon,
in the sight of his whole Army eats his Dinner,
and by his Example they are all encouraged to do
the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> use Wine at no time of the Year, they
count it profane and irreligious so to do; especially,
they abhor it on their Fasts; then no Man
is so much as to smell to it, much less to taste
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> often ask’d, why <i>Mahomet</i> was so strict, as to
forbid his Followers the use of Wine? In answer
to my demand, they told me this Story, that <i>Mahomet</i>
making a Journey to his Friend, at Noon
entred into a House where there was a Marriage-Feast,
and setting down with the Guests, he observed
them to be very merry and jovial, kissing
and embracing one another, which was attributed
to the chearfulness of their Spirits raised by the
Wine; so that he blessed the sacred Juice, as being
an Inspirer of much Love amongst Men: But returning
to the same House the next Day, he beheld
another face of Things; as Gore-blood on
the ground, a Hand cut off, an Arm, Foot, and
other Limbs dismember’d; and these, he was
told, were the effects of the Brawls and Fightings
occasioned by the Wine, which made them mad,
and destroy one another: Whereupon he changed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
his Mind, turning his former <i>Blessing</i> into a <i>Curse</i>,
and forbidding it, as an Abomination, to all his
Disciples for ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> this Reason all was quiet in the Camp, and
the greatest Composure imaginable, especially at
their Feast-time: So much did Camp-Discipline,
and a Strictness received from their Ancestors prevail
upon them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i> punish all Vice and Wickedness
very severely; their Punishments are, loss of their
Places, sale of their Goods, basting with Clubs,
Death: But Club-basting is most common, from
which the <i>Janizaries</i> themselves are not free;
though they may not, as such, be put to death.
Their lighter Offences are chastised by the Club;
their more heinous by cashiering or degrading,
which they count worse than Death, because commonly
they are put to Death afterwards; for being
stripp’d of the Ensigns of <i>Janizaries</i>, they are banish’d
to the farthest Garrison of the Empire, where
they live contemptible and inglorious, till, upon any
light Occasion, they are put to Death; yet not as
<i>Janizaries</i>, but as common Soldiers only.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> here let me acquaint you with the Patience
of the <i>Turks</i> in receiving that Punishment;
they’ll receive sometimes an hundred Blows on their
Legs, their Feet and Buttocks, with wonderful
Patience; so that diver’s Clubs are broke, and the
Executioner cries out, <i>Give me another!</i> Yea,
sometimes the Chastisement is so severe, that several
pieces of torn Flesh must be cut off from the
wounded Parts, before any thing can be applied
to cure them. Yet for all this, they must go to
their Officer, who commanded them to be punish’d;
they must kiss his Hand, and give him Thanks;
nay, they must also give the Executioner a Reward
for beating them. The Club they are beaten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
with, they count <i>sacred</i>, and that it fell down
from Heaven, as the <i>Romans</i> counted their <i>Shield</i>
to do; and, as some Relief to their Misery, they
count those Parts wounded with the Rod or Club,
to be free from any Purgations, and Expiations
after this Life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I told you, that the <i>Turk</i>’s Camps were
free from Broils and Tumults, I must except one,
which was made by my own Men: The occasion
of it was this. Some of my Servants had a mind to
ramble out of the Camp, without any <i>Janizaries</i>
to attend them; only taking some <i>Italian</i> Renegadoes
that professed the <i>Turk’s Religion</i>. Let me
tell you, by the way, that these <i>Italians</i> are of
good use in that Country, especially in redeeming
Captives; for they come to their Masters, and
pretend they are either their Kinsmen, or their
Countrymen, and therefore, out of Compassion to
them, they desire to buy them as their Patrons,
for a Price agreed, and so they set them free: But
if a <i>Christian</i> should make the same proffer to them,
they would either refuse, or hold him to a far higher
Rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return: Some of my People, as I told you,
gadding abroad, they happened to meet some <i>Janizaries</i>,
who came from Swimming and Washing
themselves in the Sea, without the Badges of their
Order on their Heads, only some Linnen being
very slightly wrapped about them. These <i>Janizaries</i>
revil’d my People, knowing them to be
<i>Christians</i>; for that’s the way of the <i>Turks</i>, to
reproach <i>Christians</i>; ’tis a Principle of their Religion,
and they think thereby to incline us to exchange
our Religion for a better, as they count
theirs to be. My Folks being thus provoked, return
Jeer for Jeer, from Words they came to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Blows, the <i>Italians</i> assisting my Men. The
cause of the Scuffle was, that one of the <i>Janizaries</i>
lost the Linnen Covering off his Head, which
was thrown I know not whither: Hereupon the
<i>Janizaries</i> hurry away to their General, complaining
of their Wrongs and Damage received
by my Servants; for they watch’d them, and found
them return’d to my House. Their General presently
sent for my Interpreter, who was present at
the Conflict: He was seiz’d upon sitting at my
Door, and they were pulling him away. I beheld
it from a Gallery above, and was much concern’d,
that any of my Family should be taken forcibly
from me without my Consent, to be carried to
the <i>Bastinado</i>, (for I understood something of the
Matter before); and I could not imagine he would
be return’d to me without being well beaten, he
being one of the <i>Turk</i>’s Subjects. Whereupon I ran
down, and laid hold on him, commanding them
to let him go. They quitted him with much ado,
but hasted immediately with far more grievous
Complaints to their General, who commanded
more of their Company to go and seize those <i>Italians</i>,
who of <i>Christians</i> are said to have become
<i>Turks</i>; yet he charged them to offer no Violence to
me, or to the House where I lodged. They came
back presently, and with a great Noise and many
Threats, demanded those <i>Italians</i>; but they, foreseeing
what would come to pass, had sailed back
to <i>Constantinople</i>. Much Clamour there was on
both sides; at last my <i>Chiaux</i> at that time, who
was an old decrepid Man, out of a jeer thrust some
Pistoles into their Hands unknown to me, to buy
a new Bonnet in the room of that which was lost;
and thus the Dispute ended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> have been the more punctual in relating this
Story, because, on this occasion, I understood
from <i>Rustan</i>’s own Mouth, what Opinion the
<i>Sultan</i> had of the <i>Janizaries</i>: For he, hearing
of this Scuffle, sent a Messenger to me, to desire
me to cut off all occasion of Dispute with the <i>Janizaries</i>
as the worst of Men. You know, said
he, ’tis a time of War, whereby <i>they</i> may be said
to reign, rather than the <i>Sultan</i>, who himself
stands in fear of them. This he spake, as being
well acquainted with the Sentiments of <i>Solyman</i>,
who always suspected some Men of their own
to lie in wait against their <i>Militia</i>, who would
break out when he had no Opportunity to prevent
them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the Truth is, though there may be some
use of a standing Guard and <i>Militia</i>, yet there
are also many Inconveniences attending it, of
which this is the chief. Their Emperor is very
fearful of them, lest, having the Sword in their
Hands, they should alter the Government as they
pleas’d, of which there had been many Precedents;
yet, there are ways also, whereby this may
be prevented.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> I was in their Camp, there came <i>Albertus
de Ubiis</i>, a worthy and learned Person, born
I think at <i>Amsterdam</i>, as an Envoy from my
Master <i>Cæsar</i>. He brought with him some Presents
for their <i>Sultan</i>, as some Goblets gilt with
Gold, with a Clock neatly made, and carried like
a Tower on an Elephant’s Back; as also some
Money to be distributed, amongst the <i>Bashaws</i>.
<i>Solyman</i> would have me deliver these Presents in the
Camp, that the Amity betwixt Him and my
Master might be more publickly known, and so no
Danger at all to be feared from the <i>Christian</i>
Arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return to <i>Bajazet</i>, after the Fight at
<i>Iconium</i>, who retired to his Government of <i>Amasia</i>,
pretending to live quietly there, if his Father
would permit him so to do. For why? He had
sown his wild Oats, and for the future seem’d pliable
to obey his Father’s Will; and for this he employed
sundry Persons to carry submissive Letters
to his Father, begging his Pardon: Neither did
<i>Solyman</i> pretend that he was averse to a Reconciliation
with his Son, and therefore he admitted
his Messengers into his Presence. He read his
Letters, and answered them mildly: So that the
Report was spread over all the Army, what an
Agreement was like to be between Father and Son;
what he had done amiss, was to be imputed to the
hot Blood of his youthful Age, provided he would
shew himself obsequious for the residue of his Life.
This <i>Solyman</i> did by the Advice of his <i>Bashaws</i>;
for the cunning old Man would not declare himself,
till he had brought <i>Bajazet</i> into the Noose of his
own Power. He was terribly afraid, lest out of
Desperation he should march furiously into <i>Persia</i>
(his only place of Refuge,) with such furious Expedition,
that all his <i>Sanziacks</i> should not be able
to get before him. To prevent which Mistakes,
he sent many Letters to all the Governors upon
the Borders, to watch <i>Bajazet</i>, and not to suffer
him to escape, if he should attempt it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean time, he put all those of <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Party, that he could get into his Hands,
to the Rack; and when he had sifted out of
them what he could, he put them privately to
Death; amongst which were some that <i>Bajazet</i>
had sent to clear him to his Father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Kingdom of <i>Persia</i> at that time contained
all the Countries between the <i>Caspian</i> Sea, and
the Seas of <i>Persia</i>, with some part of <i>Armenia</i> the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
Greater, (though <i>Solyman</i>, by taking <i>Babylon</i>,
<i>Mesopotamia</i>, and part of <i>Media</i>, had abridged their
Empire very much) and other distant Countries
even to the Empire of the <i>Homamia Patisach</i>, as
the <i>Turks</i> call him, and over that last part of Land
<i>Sagthamas</i> was King: The Father had been formerly
over-thrown by <i>Selimus</i> in a great Fight in
the field of <i>Chalderon</i>; and from that time the
<i>Persian</i> Affairs began to decline, for <i>Solyman</i> a
fierce Engineer press’d upon the very Face of them;
and <i>Thamas</i>, being much inferior to his Father in
Courage, made but weak Defence: For he was
wholly given up to Sloth and Idleness, and would
sit in his Palace amongst a croud of Harlots, amorously
pleasing his Humour; and sometimes consulting
Magicians concerning future Events: He
had little Care of administring public Justice to
his People. This Neglect of his opened the Door
to all Injustice and Oppression in every part of his
Empire: For the Strong oppressed the Weaker,
and Innocence could find no Justice or Defence in
his Court.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Persians</i>, however, have so sacred an
Opinion of their Prince, that they believe him
happy, that can but kiss the Gates of his Palace;
and the Water wherein he washes his Hands,
they use for the cure of several Diseases. He
hath many Children, but the most promising is
<i>Ismael</i>, like his Grandfather both in Name and
Nature; a beautiful Prince, and a capital Enemy
to the Race of the <i>Ottomans</i>. ’Tis reported that
he was brought forth into the World, with his
Fist all bloody, whence it was in every body’s
Mouth, that he would be a warlike Person;
and when he was but young he confirmed that
Report, by obtaining a great Victory over the
<i>Turks</i>. But when his Father made Peace with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
<i>Solyman</i>, ’twas agreed betwixt them, that <i>Ismael</i>
should be sent Prisoner into the Bowels of his
Kingdom, that he might be no Obstacle to the
intended Agreement: And yet, as ill us’d as he is,
after his Father’s Death, ’tis thought, he will succeed
in the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>Solyman</i> fearing that <i>Sagthamas</i>, (or, as
we call him, the <i>Sophi</i>) would be more mindful
of old Grudges, than of the late Peace to which
he was in a manner compell’d; and that, if his
Son went thither, he should have much ado to
get him thence; and perhaps it might occasion a
long War between the Empires, did use his utmost
endeavour to stop or take him, before he
could come thither. The old Man had not forgot
that, a few Years before, <i>Helcas</i>, <i>Thamas</i>’s
Brother, had fled to him, and had been supported
by him, and it cost his Brother dear to recover
him; and therefore he feared that <i>Thamas</i> would
pay him in his own Coin, and perhaps recover
by the Sword all the Countries he had taken from
him. The Design of <i>Solyman</i> was kept very secret,
yet <i>Bajazet</i>’s Friends smelt it out, and
therefore advised him by no means to trust his
Father, but to consult his own Safety, by what
way soever he could. And <i>Bajazet</i> was persuaded
so to do upon a small occasion, as little Matters
often give Weight to greater. There was a Soldier
of <i>Bajazet</i>’s taken in <i>Solyman</i>’s Camp, and
hang’d up as a Spy, because <i>Bajazet</i> had listed him,
after his Father had given him strict Charge to
list no more Soldiers. This was warning enough
to <i>Bajazet</i> to pack up and be gone. Now <i>Solyman</i>
thought himself sure of <i>Bajazet</i>; and, to deceive
him the more, he caused his Army to begin
their March to <i>Constantinople</i> the Day after
<i>Easter</i>. But <i>Bajazet</i>, immediately after Prayers
upon <i>Easter-Day</i>, gave Orders for marching with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
Bag and Baggage, and began his unfortunate
Voyage to <i>Persia</i>. He knew well enough that
he went to the old Enemy of the <i>Ottoman</i> House,
but was resolv’d to try the mercy of any body, rather
than fall into his Father’s Hands. There
marched out with him all that were able to bear
Arms; none were left behind but weak Persons,
Women and Children, that were not able to bear
the fatigue of so long a Journey; amongst which
was a new-born Child of his own, with his Mother,
whose Innocency he thought would protect
them from his Father’s Cruelty, and therefore he
thought it best to leave them to his Clemency, rather
than make them Companions of his woeful
and miserable Fight; and the truth is, <i>Solyman</i>,
as yet uncertain what would become of the Father,
spared the Life of his Infant-Son at present, and
sent him to be educated at <i>Prusia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> would have return’d to <i>Constantinople</i>, the Day
before <i>Easter</i>, but had a great mind to see, how
the <i>Turks</i> did observe that Festival; and I was not
sure that ever I should have so fair an Opportunity
again. They were to celebrate it in the open
Field, before the Emperor’s own Tent. I, therefore,
ordered my Servants to take a Room in the
Tent of a <i>Turkish</i> Soldier, that stood on a rising
Ground, and look’d down on <i>Solyman</i>’s Tent,
which was over against it. Thither went I at
Sun-rising, where, in an open Plain, I beheld a
vast multitude of turbanted Heads silently standing,
and taking down the last Words of their
Priest. Every Rank was ranged orderly, and
standing, that in the open Field they seemed to
be a Wall one to another: The most Honourable
had their Station next the Emperor’s Train, uppermost
in the Camp, and their Turbants as white as
Snow. Such diversity of Colours did affect me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
with a great deal of Pleasure, and the rather, because
they stood unmoveable, as if they had grown
upon the Place; not a Cough hawking to spit, nor
any Sound to be heard; no, nor the least moving
of the Head to look backward, or about them.
At the Name of <i>Mahomet</i>, they all, as one Man,
bowed their Heads, even to the Knee; but when
the Name of God was pronounced, they all fell
prostrate on their Faces, and kissed the Ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the Truth is, the <i>Turks</i> are very ceremonious
and attentive in the acts of their religious
Worship; for, if a Man doth but scratch his Head
when he prays, they think his Prayer is lost. For
thus say they, if a Man composes his Body so
reverently, even when he speaks but to a <i>Bashaw</i>,
how much more becoming is that Observance towards
God, who is infinitely greater than the
greatest of Men?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Prayers, the whole Congregation was
discharged, and they ran up and down ranging
over the Fields. A while after the Emperor’s
Dinner is served up, which the <i>Janizaries</i> carry
away Dish by Dish, and eat it with a great
deal of Mirth and Drollery. ’Tis an old allowed
Custom for them so to do, on that day, their Emperor
being provided of a Dinner elsewhere. When
I had beheld their Show, I returned with great
Pleasure to <i>Constantinople</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remainder of my Talk, is, to acquaint you
what become of <i>Bajazet</i>, and then I shall ease you
of the trouble of Reading, and my self of Writing.
He, as I told you, with his invincible Band,
march’d out of <i>Amasia</i> with such Speed, that his
coming prevented the Report thereof; and those
<i>Bashaws</i>, who designed to observe his Motion, he
came upon unawares. He put a notable Cheat
upon the <i>Bashaw</i> of <i>Suvas</i>; for whereas, there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
were two ways in his Province by which he might
march, and the <i>Bashaw</i> had beset the chiefest of
them; he sent some before him that pretended to
be Run-a-ways, to inform him, he was gone the
farthest way about; which giving Credit to, he
removed his Troops thither to prevent him, and so
left <i>Bajazet</i> a free Passage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">He</span> put the like Trick upon the <i>Bashaw</i> of <i>Erzerumen</i>;
for, knowing that the Passage through
the Province would be very hazardous, he sent
some before him with a counterfeit Message, to salute
him, and tell him, that his Misfortunes had
reduced him to the most miserable Condition, and
therefore he desired him that he might rest a day or
two in his Province, at least to get his Horses fed,
and new shod.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Bashaw</i> granted his Request, whereas, it
was not a commiserating his Case, or that he favoured
his Side, but, perhaps, that he might amuse
him a little till he had got all his Troops together
to ensnare him; for they were scattered, as not
dreaming he would be so soon upon him. However,
<i>Bajazet</i> march’d continually on, allowing
his Men no rest by day, and very little at Night.
The <i>Bashaw</i> of <i>Erzerumen</i> seeing himself deceived,
made haste to join himself with the other
<i>Bashaws</i> in his Flight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span>, you must know, as soon as <i>Solyman</i> heard
his Son was gone from <i>Amasia</i>, he commanded
a great many <i>Sanziacks</i> and <i>Bashaw</i> to follow,
and upon pain of Death, to bring him either alive
or dead: But all in vain, for <i>Bajazet</i> fled faster
than they could pursue. The <i>Bashaws</i> aforementioned,
paid dear enough for letting him escape;
for <i>Solyman</i> put him out of his Place, but <i>Selimus</i>
put him to Death, together with his two Boys,
though not before they had been most detestably used.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
<i>Selimus</i> and <i>Mehemet Bassa</i>, and the <i>Beglerbeg</i> of
<i>Greece</i>, pursued <i>Bajazet</i> at a greater distance.
<i>Solyman</i> was much troubled when he heard of his
Escape, as being well assured, he would make
towards <i>Persia</i>; and thereupon he was about to
gather all his Forces, both Horse and Foot, together,
and so march away to declare War against
<i>Persia</i>: But his wiser Counsellors stopped his
March, alledging the hazard he would run amongst
an ungrateful Soldiery: And besides, say they,
what if <i>Bajazet</i> out of his Temerity and Rashness
should send a Company about <i>Pontus</i> and the <i>Palus
Mæotis</i>, and so march back to <i>Constantinople</i>,
in the Emperor’s Absence, where he might, by
promising Liberty to Captives, and to the <i>Agiamoglans</i>,
get upon the Throne, now vacant?
These Advices restrained <i>Solyman</i> from his Intention.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Bajazet</i></span>, all along his March, caused Labels to
be fixed to the Doors of the Houses, that he would
give double Pay to all the Soldiers that would revolt
to him; which made <i>Solyman</i>’s Soldiers suspected
by their Officers, and the rather, because
the common Soldiers talked very freely in favour
of <i>Bajazet</i>. After much ado, <i>Bajazet</i> escaped to
the River <i>Araxes</i>, which is the Bounds betwixt
the two Empires of <i>Turkey</i> and <i>Persia</i>; and after
he had pass’d this River, he scarce thought himself
secure, but appointed some of his own Soldiers to
guard the Banks, that so the pursuing <i>Sanziacks</i>
might not pass over: They, however, being but
few, were easily discomfited before the <i>Turkish</i> Commanders
pass’d farther into <i>Persia</i>; till at last they
met with a great Body of <i>Persian</i> Horse, whose
Commanders demanded of them, why they invaded
another Prince’s Territories? Their Answer was,
they were to fetch the fugitive Son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
their own Prince. The <i>Persians</i> told ’em, ’twas
contrary to the League to come armed into their
Dominions; there was Peace betwixt <i>Sagthamas</i>
and <i>Solyman</i>, which they ought not to violate:
As for <i>Bajazet</i>, their Prince would do what was
fitting; in the mean time they should retreat to
their own Country. With this Reprimand they
direct their March backward. In the mean time
Messengers are immediately sent from <i>Persia</i> to
<i>Bajazet</i>, to bid him return, and to know the cause
of his coming, and also to spy out what Forces
he had brought with him. <i>Bajazet</i> answers, that
his Brother’s Insolency, and his Father’s Displeasure,
had driven him out of his own Country, and he
was come to <i>Persia</i>, as the only Refuge for an oppressed
Prince; and therefore, in consideration of
the uncertainty of future Affairs, he hoped he
would afford him Protection, being destitute of all
Things. The <i>Persian</i> answered, he was not well
advised to repair to him who had made a Peace
with his Father; by which they were both bound
to serve the same Friend and Enemy, and that
League he could not violate: Nevertheless, since
he was come, he bid him welcome, and promised
he would do his utmost to reconcile him to his Father.
Thus his first Entertainment in <i>Persia</i> was
promising enough; nought but Congratulations,
Feastings, friendly Entertainments, and Merrymakings,
by which subtle Men disguise their
Meanings; nay, there was a talk of a Match between
<i>Orchanes</i>, <i>Bajazet</i>’s Son, and one of the
<i>Sophi</i>’s Daughters; and they gave him Hopes,
that the <i>Sophi</i> would never be at quiet, till <i>Solyman</i>
had bestowed upon him the Government of <i>Mesopotamia</i>,
or <i>Babylon</i>, or <i>Arzerum</i>; for there, say
they, you may live commodiously without Fear,
as being at a great distance, both from your Brother<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
and your Father too; and if either of them
should deal hardly with you, you will have a
Father-in-law to fly to, who will afford you
Sanctuary. Such Discourses were received among
the Vulgar, to divert <i>Bajazet</i>’s thoughts
from the apprehension of present Danger. The
<i>Sophi</i> sent many Ambassadors to <i>Solyman</i> on this
Errand; but whether he dealt sincerely with <i>Bajazet</i>
to reconcile him to his Father, or no, might
be a great question, since in the mean time, he
contrived all ways to destroy him; for <i>Sagthamas</i>
was in a mighty Fear, lest he should nourish a
Serpent in his Bosom, and that which encreased
his Rancour, was, the wicked design of some, who
persuaded <i>Bajazet</i> to attempt the destroying of <i>Sagthamas</i>;
for one of <i>Bajazet</i>’s Commanders was
heard to say, <i>Why do we not kill this Heretick, and
possess his Kingdoms? For, without doubt, he will
one day be the Ruin of us all.</i> These wild Discourses
coming to <i>Sagthamas</i>’s Ears, put him upon a
Project more necessary than plausible; for <i>Bajazet</i>
had not many Forces, but very warlike ones;
and there were many valiant Men among them
that were ready to attempt any Invasion, and therefore
he had reason to fear. He was conscious, also,
that he had added new Kingdoms to his own, as
being conquer’d on pretence of Religion; and who
would secure such sickly Subjects, who were weary
of their present State, and coveted a Change?
To these nothing could be more reasonable than
the coming of <i>Bajazet</i>. As yet, however, he is
more in my Power, than I am in his, and therefore
it were best to improve the Opportunity, and treat
him no longer as a Guest, but as an Enemy to be
chained up. To compass which, no Method was
more adviseable than to sever him from his Forces,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
for then he may be more easily trapp’d; by open
Force ’tis hard to seize him, his Soldiers being well
train’d and disciplin’d, but mine slothful, unaccustomed
to Arms, and, besides, at a great Distance
one from another. Hereupon <i>Bajazet</i> was advised
to disband his Army as unnecessary. He
could not withstand the Proposal, though Intelligent
Men foresaw the Danger and Consequence:
But, alas! He that was under another Man’s Roof,
must now be at their Beck, who maintained him;
especially, since it would breed a Suspicion, if he
entertained so much as a thought of Perfidiousness
in his Host that entertained him. Hereupon his
Men were divided, never to see one another again,
and quartered where the <i>Persians</i> pleased; and,
being put here and there, were, very shortly after slain
by them, and their Arms, Horses, and all else they
had, fell a prey to the superior Numbers of the
Destroyers. At the same time <i>Bajazet</i> was clapp’d
up in Prison, with his Children; and, to encrease
the indignity of the Thing, he was haled even
from a Feast, to a Dungeon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> have I satisfied your Desire, in acquainting
you with what has been hitherto done with
<i>Bajazet</i>: ’Tis time now to consider what will
become of him for the future: Some think he
will retreat to <i>Babylon</i>, or such-like Province, on
the Borders of each Empire, to be <i>Sanziack</i> thereof.
Others think it a desperate Case, and that
there is no hope of his Life, either from <i>Solyman</i>
or <i>Sagthamas</i>; but that he will either be sent back
hither to be put to Death, or strangled in Prison
there.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> the <i>Persian</i> weighed every thing in his
Thoughts, when he put <i>Bajazet</i> in Prison; he
knew him to be of an aspiring and courageous Spirit,
far superior to his Brother; and that, if he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
should succeed his Father in the Empire, it might
do <i>Persia</i> much more Mischief than ever <i>Selimus</i>
could; for he was but a slothful Prince, and not
at all for a War, and therefore some thought he
would never escape out of his Hands; for to be
sure he can never be a Friend to one he hath injured
so much. Some think one thing, and some
another: For my part, I think it will be an intricate
Business. For, as <i>Bajazet</i> is in Troubles,
and the Issue undetermin’d, they will not easily
make War on <i>Christendom</i> at this Juncture. They
labour to obtrude on me certain conditions of
Peace, having some Letters that will please my
Master, but they allow me no Copy of them, as
heretofore they used to do; so that I suspect Fraud
in the case, and therefore do peremptorily refuse
to send those Letters to <i>Cæsar</i>, unless I first know
their Contents; and if they deceive me by a false
Copy, then the Blame lies at their Door, not at
mine: By this means I shall free my Master from
answering their captious Letters; for I am sure
he will accept of no conditions of Peace but such
as are honourable. But, you’ll say, if you refuse
to accept of their conditions of Peace, ’tis one step
towards a War. Let that be as it will, I judge it
more adviseable to leave all free to the events of
future Ages: But the not sending their Letters,
if that be a Crime, I shall take up on my self; and
I shall easily clear my self, if the Issue of <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Affairs do not answer their Expectation; since it
is yet very difficult, though not impossible, for
the <i>Turks</i> are not irreconcileable to those Ambassadors,
who study to do their Master the best Service
they can amongst them. And besides, the declining
Age of my Prince will be some advantage to me,
who the <i>Bashaws</i> thinks is fitter for rest and quiet,
than for the Fatigues of an unnecessary War. ’Tis<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
true, my Pains will be prolonged hereby, but I shall
think them best bestowed, if they succeed at last.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span>, Sir, I have written you a Book rather
than a Letter; and if I have offended you in it, the
fault is yours rather than mine: What I did was at
your Request, and Readiness to please a Friend, hath
always been counted a Vertue in Friendship. Yet
I hope these Things will be as pleasant for you to
Read, as they were delightful for me to Write;
for, let me tell you, as soon as I put Pen to Paper,
I love to wander abroad in my Mind, that so I may
as it were, deceive my Confinement as long as I can,
and converse with you as if we were together. What
things seem frivolous and needless, you must take,
as proceeding by word of Mouth in familiar Conferences
among Friends. Men may be allow’d to
tittle tattle in a Letter, as well as in common Discourse.
If I were to write Inscriptions for Churches
and Temples, to be seen of all Men, Circumspection
and Care must be used; but not when I write
to you and a few private Friends. I aim not at
Fame; if my Lines please you, I have enough.
You will say, perhaps, I might have written better
Latin: I grant it; but what if it were beyond my
Ability? It was not for want of any good will; and
yet, let me ask you, what good Latin can come
out of uncouth <i>Greece</i>, or barbarous <i>Turkey</i>? If you
have any Value for my Letters, you shall have
more of them after my Return to <i>Vienna</i>, if ever
God permit me to return: If not, excuse the last
Trouble I shall give you. Farewell.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="smcap">I</span> Acknowledge the fresh Proof you
give me of Old Friendship, in congratulating
my Return; and, as
you require an Account of the Residue
of my Embassy, and what
Occurrences have happened since
my last to you, I will remember
my Promise to you, and never disoblige so choice
a Friend. Take them all in a Medley together,
what comes next into my Head, as my Memory
suggests things more, or less serious. My beginning
is upon the mournful; it is this. I was scarce settled
in my Mind, which was troubled for <i>Bajazet</i>’s Misfortunes
and Death, when, lo! I was struck with
another Message as sorrowful as the former. We were
all in great Expectation of the Success of the <i>Turkish</i>
Fleet, which sailed toward the Isle of <i>Meninge</i>,
(now called <i>Gerse</i>,) upon News that the <i>Spaniards</i>
had prevailed there. For <i>Solyman</i> (being assured
that Island was taken by the <i>Christians</i>, and that
they had added new Fortifications to the old Castle
therein, in which they had yet a very strong Garrison,)
could not endure to be thus check’d in the
midst of all the Prosperities of his flourishing Empire.
Hereupon he equipp’d a Navy with Auxiliaries to
relieve those that were <i>Mahometans</i> like himself;
and made <i>Pihal Bassa</i> Commander of his Fleet. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
furnish’d his Ships with a select Company of Soldiers,
and yet was doubtful of the Event; because
the Voyage was long, and they were to engage
with a formidable Enemy. For you may please
to be inform’d, that the <i>Turks</i>, for a long time,
have had a great Opinion of the Valour of the
<i>Spaniards</i>, as knowing that they have waged great
Wars, and came off with good Success. They
had heard of the Emperor <i>Charles</i>, and of his Son
<i>Philip</i>, the Heir of his Valour, as well as of his
Kingdoms. The Report of his Power made the
<i>Turks</i> very solicitous; so that those that went the
Voyage, made their last Wills, as if they were
never to return to <i>Constantinople</i> again. Thus the
whole City, both those that went, and those that
staid at Home, was filled with Anxiety. But,
alas! their Fleet sailed with a prosperous Gale, and
came upon the <i>Christians</i> unawares; which struck
such a Terror into them, that they knew not how
to fight or fly: Some nimble Vessels made their
Escape; the rest were either taken by the Enemy,
or split and dash’d in pieces on the Sands. The
Duke of <i>Medina</i> the General, and <i>John Andrea
Doria</i> the Admiral, fled to the Castle, from whence
they escap’d in a dark Night, undiscovered, through
the Enemy’s Fleet to <i>Sicily</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Pihal</i></span> sent hither a Galley to give an account
of this Victory, and, as a further Testimony
thereof, he caused a Banner, wherein was the
Image of our Saviour Christ upon the Cross, to be
pulled along the Sea, at the stern of the Vessel.
As soon as it arrived in the Haven, the Loss of
the <i>Christians</i> was presently noised abroad, and
the <i>Turks</i> congratulated one another upon their
Victory. They came thick and three-fold to my
Door, and asked my Servants in a Jeer, whether
they had any Brother, or other Friend, in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
<i>Spanish</i> Fleet? If you had, said they, you may
shortly have the opportunity of seeing their Faces
here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Besides</span>, they highly extoll’d their own Valour,
and blam’d the Cowardise of the <i>Christians</i>.
Who, say they, shall now be able to stand before
us, seeing we have conquered the <i>Spaniards</i>?
My People were forced to hear this sad News to
their great Grief; but God’s Will must be done!
Our only Hope was, that the Castle, in which
was a strong Garrison, might hold out against
the <i>Turks</i> till the Winter, or some other Accident
had rais’d the Siege. And yet our Hopes were
mix’d with Fears, that the Conqueror would take
that too; and so it fell out, for the Besieged
wanted all things, especially Water; so that
<i>Don Alvarez de Sande</i>, the Governor thereof, a
courageous Man, and an old Soldier, perceiving
that it could be defended no longer, got a Boat,
and made his Escape, with a few Companions, towards
<i>Sicily</i>, that so he might not behold the Surrender
of so important a Place, which he thought
would be look’d upon as a Blot in his Escutcheon,
though the extreamest Necessity had compelled it.
When he was gone, the Soldiers opened the
Gates, and let in the <i>Turks</i>, hoping to find them
the more merciful, because of their easy Admittance.
<i>Don John</i> of <i>Castile</i>, however, would by
no means leave the Fort which he commanded,
but he and his Brother valiantly repulsing the
Enemy, were at last wounded and taken. The
Castle was stoutly defended by the <i>Spaniards</i> for
three Month’s Space, though they wanted many
Necessaries, and, which was worst of all, had no
prospect of Relief. The Weather was hot, and
they almost parched with Thirst. They had but
one Cistern to hold Water in, which was not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
big enough to serve them all; so that they were
compelled to weigh out their Water to each Man
by Measure, only enough to keep Life and Soul
together. This Cistern-Water was increased with
a Mixture of Sea-Water, and by some curious
Art made fresh. This Secret was very opportunely
told them by a certain Alchymist: But all had not
the Benefit of it; for you should see some lie
parching on the Ground, ready to give up the
Ghost for very Thirst, continually crying out,
as well as they could speak, <i>Water! Water!</i>
and, if a little was brought, they were relieved
for the present; but, when that Moisture was
spent, they relapsed to their former Drought, and
died thereof. Thus many perished, besides the
Wounded, who could have no help of Surgery to
cure them in that desolate Place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the Month of <i>September</i>, the victorious Navy
of the <i>Turks</i> returned to <i>Constantinople</i>, bringing
the <i>Christians</i> Captives, with their Gallies along
with them. A joyful Spectacle to the <i>Turks</i>;
but a sad one to the <i>Christians</i> that lived amongst
them! That Night it lay at Anchor near the
Rocks over against <i>Byzantium</i>, that so they might
enter the Port the next Day in greater Pomp and
Splendor. <i>Solyman</i> came down into an Apartment
in his Gardens near the Sea-side, that from thence
he might see the Prisoners entring in. <i>Don Alvarez
de Sande</i> was in the stern of his Admiral Galley,
and with him, <i>Don Sancho de Leyva</i>, and <i>Don
Bellinger de Requesne</i>, one Commander of the
<i>Sicilian</i> Galleys, the other of the <i>Neapolitan</i>. The
Galleys of the <i>Christians</i> were despoiled of their
Ornaments, as Streamers, <i>&amp;c.</i> and hall’d in
Barques, that they might appear little and contemptible
in the sight of the <i>Turks</i>. They who
observ’d <i>Solyman</i>’s Countenance at that time say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
that they perceived no sign of insolent Mirth therein.
This is certain, that when I saw him go to
his Devotion the next day, his Countenance was
not altered from its usual Hue, as if that Victory
had not concern’d him at all; so well was this
cunning old Man able to bear the breath of his
smiling Fortune, that he was unmov’d under
it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Prisoners were afterwards brought into
the <i>Seraglio</i>, but so miserably hunger-starv’d before,
that some could hardly stand on their Legs, others
fell down in a Swoon for very Feebleness; others
had Arms in a Jeer put upon them, in which
posture they died; the <i>Turks</i> insulting over them
on every Hand, and promising to themselves the
Empire of the whole World; for who now shall
be able to stand before us, (said they) since we
have overcome the <i>Spaniards</i>? There was a
Commander in the <i>Turkish</i> Fleet, with whom I
had some Acquaintance, who had taken the great
Banner of the <i>Neapolitans</i> Galleys, being Imperial
Eagles embracing one another; being inform’d
that he was about to present it to <i>Solyman</i>, I thought
good to prevent him; and sending him two silken
Garments, I obtained the Banner, that so the
Ensign of <i>Charles</i> the Fifth might not remain in
the Hands of Infidels, to the eternal Infamy of the
Christian Name.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> were amongst the Prisoners, besides
those above-mentioned, these two eminent Persons,
<i>Don John</i> of <i>Cordona</i>, the Son in Law of <i>Don
Bellinger</i>, and <i>Don Gasto</i>, the Son of the Duke of
<i>Medina</i>, who, though but a Youth, had an honourable
Post in his Father’s Army, <i>Don John</i> promised
to give a great Sum of Money to be left
Prisoner at <i>Chios</i>, (which was inhabited by the
old <i>Genoese</i>) which was accordingly done. As<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
for <i>Don Gasto</i>, he was concealed by <i>Pihal</i>, in
hopes to have a large Price for his Redemption;
which Project of his had like to have proved his
Ruin: For <i>Solyman</i>, by some means or other,
smelt out the Cheat, and was grievously vex’d
that <i>Pihal</i> should serve him such a Trick. He
resolv’d, at the Instigation also of <i>Rustan</i>, that
<i>Gasto</i> should be brought to Light, that so <i>Pihal</i>
might be punish’d; but <i>Gasto</i> died in the Search;
some say, of the Plague, others by the procurement
of <i>Pihal</i> himself, that he might tell no
Tales. This is certain, that, upon the most diligent
Search, he could not be found. However,
<i>Pihal</i> was afraid to come to <i>Constantinople</i> to appear
before his angry Master, lest he might be imprisoned
there; but he hovered with a few Galleys about
several Islands of the <i>Ægæan</i> Sea, pretending divers
Excuses for so doing. But at last <i>Solyman</i>,
by the persuasion of the chief Eunuch of his Son
<i>Selimus</i> gave him his Pardon in these Words: <i>I,
for my part, forgive him his great Offence; but
God Almighty, the just Revenger of all Wickedness,
inflict just Punishment on him in the Life to come!</i>
So strongly are the <i>Turks</i> persuaded, that no evil
Fact should pass unpunished!</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Don John</i></span> of <i>Cordona</i> fared better; for, by the
care of <i>Adam a Ditrichstein</i>, Baron of <i>Austria</i>,
who married his Sister, and by my engaging for
him, he returned safe into <i>Spain</i>. As for <i>de
Sande</i>, he was brought into the <i>Divan</i>, and there
<i>Rustan</i> demanded of him, what his Master meant
by invading other Men’s Rights, when he could
not maintain his own? <i>De Sande</i> answered, the
Question belonged not to him to answer; ’twas his
part only to execute his Master’s Commands as
faithfully as he could, wherein Fortune had been
against him. However, he begged the <i>Bashaws</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
upon his Knees, that, in regard he had a Wife
and Children at Home, they would speak a good
Word for him to <i>Solyman</i>. <i>Rustan</i> answered,
that their Emperor was of a merciful Disposition,
and that they would intercede for him. Thus was
he sent Prisoner to the Castle called <i>Caradenis</i>,
that is, <i>of the Black Sea</i>: He was not gone far,
before he was sent for back again, because the
Chief of the Bed-Chamber had not seen him;
who, I have find before, is a Man of great Authority
with his Prince. Upon this Countermand,
some say, that, though otherwise undaunted, he
was a little faint-hearted, as fearing he was brought
back to his Ruin; but it proved otherwise. As
for the other Prisoners, the chief of them, as <i>Sancho
de Leyva</i> with his two natural Sons, and <i>Don
Bellinger</i> himself, were sent into the Castle of
<i>Pera</i>, or <i>Galata</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> soon as I was made acquainted with their
Condition, and in what want of all Things they
were, I thought it my Duty to do my best to relieve
them; and thereupon I sent some to comfort
them, and to promise them all the good Offices
that lay in my power: And, from that Day
forward, my House was a common Receptacle
for all the Prisoners; and I did them all the Kindness
I could. For, you must know, the <i>Turks</i>
think their Prisoners well enough provided for, if
they allow them Bread and Water. They have
no regard to any Man’s Age or Constitution, or
to the time of the Year; whether they be Sick or
Well, Strong or Weak, Old or Young, ’tis all
one to them; they are all treated after one and
the same manner. Hereupon, I was forced to
provide several sorts of Relief for several Necessities,
different Diseases requiring different Cures. There
lay a multitude of sick Persons in a certain Temple<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of <i>Pera</i>, a Town over against <i>Byzantium</i>, whom
the <i>Turks</i> cast out as Abjects; and many of them
perished for want of convenient Broths to relieve
their sick Stomachs, and recover their lost Strength
by degrees. When I was told thereof, I dealt
with a Friend of mine, a Citizen of <i>Pera</i>, desiring
him to buy some Weather-Sheep every day,
and boil them at his own House, to distribute the
Flesh to some, and the Broth to others, as their
Stomachs could bear; which was a great Relief
to abundance of them: But those which were in
Health, required another sort of Assistance. My
House was full from Morning to Night with several
Complaints. Some were used to good Diet,
and a piece of brown Bread, which was their daily
Allowance, would not go down so well with
them; some, that used to drink Wine, could
not bear the perpetual use of Water only; some
wanted Blankets to cover them, having never
known what it was to lie on the bare Ground;
some wanted Coats, others Shoes; but the most
part desired some Footing-Money to gratify their
Keepers, that they might deal the more mercifully
with them. Money was the only Remedy
for these Mischiefs, so that every day some Guilders
were expended by me on these Accounts.
But these Expences were tolerable, compared with
greater Sums which were desired of me; or else
they prayed me to be their Surety for payment
of their Ransom-Money; and herein every one,
was very forward with his Pretences; one alledged
Nobleness of Birth; another, that he had
great Friends and Alliances; a Third, that he
was a Commander in the Army, and had much
Pay due to him; a Fourth, that he had Cash
enough at Home, and was able to imburse me.
Some boasted of their Valour in the Fight; every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
one had something to say for himself. When I
demanded of them, whether they would be sure
to repay me? God forbid, said they! For what
is more unjust, than to defraud a Man who hath
restored us to our Liberty, even out of the Jaws
of Death?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> the Truth is, it was very grievous to me,
to hear a Man come and tell me, unless I can
lay down 200 Guilders for my Redemption, I
am undone for ever; I shall be sent over into
<i>Asia</i> to be made a Galley-Slave, to tug at the
Oar, without any hope to see my own Country
again. There is a Merchant, Sir, that will deposit
Wares amounting to that Value, provided
you will promise Repayment. This was the Allegation
of almost all of them; which could not
but affect me, as knowing it to be most true, that,
if they were not relieved, many of them must needs
perish; and none could better do it, nor could
they more justly expect it from any Man, than
my self. But, you will say, there is no trusting
any Body; to which I answer, can any Man be so
prodigiously ungrateful, as not to repay what was laid
out to save his Life; and, grant that one or two
may not have Ability to reimburse me, what’s
that to the purpose? ’Tis not lost, that which is
laid out to relieve the Oppressed: But sure the
greater part of them will perform their Promise.
For these Reasons, I was induced to pass my Word
for 1000 Ducats, and have thereby run my self
so much in Debt, that I know not how to get
out; but I fear have freed them from Fetters, and
clapp’d them on my own Legs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> am the larger upon this Subject, to purge my
self from too much Weakness, which I know some
will accuse me of, in being ready to trust every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
body; and, in some Measure, to take the blame upon
my self for the slackness of some, for whom I have
undertaken in their Repayments. I foresee I shall
be a great loser by the Business; for I must necessarily
make Payment on the Day, when my Word
was once passed: And besides, I heard that some
whom I had released, had laughed at my easy
Nature, in believing what they said to be true;
so that my Case is bad, if I should judge of the
rest by them. But, be it as it will, I thank my
God, that I have been able to do so many good
Offices to so many distressed Persons. I do not repent it;
for Virtue is a sufficient Reward to it
self. I covet not, that any Honours should be
conferred on me, nor any Statue erected for my
Beneficence; I only wish, that they would be so
grateful, as to pay me what I am out of Pocket,
to save their Lives; of which I despair not from
so cordial a Nation as the <i>Spaniards</i> are. For my
part, I rejoice not only that I did them a good
turn, but that thereby I gave an Example and
Invitation to others to do the same.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> live many Merchants in <i>Pera</i>, <i>Italians</i>
by Birth, who are very assistant in relieving
Christian-Prisoners; but one of them deserves to
be particularly mentioned, for the absurdity of his
Opinion, differing from all the rest. He was an
<i>Italian Greek</i>, that is, one who resembles both
those Nations in his Birth and Manners. When
his Country-men were mercifully busied in relieving
Prisoners, he could never be persuaded to
give one Farthing towards so pious a Work; and,
being blamed for it, his Answer was, (which he
uttered in a barbarous and blunt <i>Italian</i> Style,
the <i>Greek</i> being more familiar to him,) I know
not, what these Men are; but this I know, that
the just Judgment of God hath brought them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
into this miserable Condition. For my part, I will
not oppose the Will of God; let them abide in that
Place God hath allotted them. You, who so boldly
withstand what God hath decreed, may pity them
if you please; but I will not spare a Doit to release
them, though you use never so many Arguments
to persuade me: But enough of this vain and foolish
Fellow. This Loss at Sea, together with the Misfortune
of <i>Bajazet</i>, struck a great Terror into me,
that the <i>Turks</i>, made more insolent thereby, would
hearken to no Conditions of Peace. This publick
Calamity was seconded by a private one; the Plague
was got into my House; one of my faithful Servant
died of it, and the rest were terribly afraid of
the Infection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span>, before I speak of that, there was another
Case surprised me, arising on this account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Solyman</i></span> grows every Day more and more Superstitious
in his Religion. He used to delight himself
in Musick, and in the chanting of young Singers;
but all this was laid aside, by means of a certain
old Sibyl, noted for Sanctity, who told him, that,
if he left not off that Sport, he would be severely
punished after his Death. He was so moved herewith,
that he cast his Musical Instruments, though
richly studded with Gold and Jewels, into the Fire
and burnt them: And, whereas he formerly eat
his Meat out of Silver Dishes, now he was persuaded
to use none but Earthen Platters. He was
also prevailed upon by her to forbid the use of Wine,
wherein she told him too great a liberty was used,
which his Prophet would be angry at, if he longer
suffered it. Hereupon an Edict was published, that
for the future no Wine should be imported into
<i>Constantinople</i>, either for <i>Christians</i> or <i>Jews</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Edict did much concern me and mine,
who had never used to drink Water; and what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
Wine could we have, if it were forbid? Our long
absence from our Country, and the uncertain issue
of our Embassy, were a sufficient Mortification to
us, without this other Inconvenience of change of
Diet, which must needs indanger our Health.
Hereupon I desired my Interpreters to intercede for
me in the <i>Divan</i>, that I might retain my ancient
Right. The <i>Bashaws</i> Men were of different Opinions
in the Case; some alledged, we ought to be
content with Water as well as they; for what would
the Neighbourhood say, if <i>Christians</i> may drink
Wine, and themselves be strictly forbid the use of it?
If <i>Christians</i> in the midst of <i>Constantinople</i>, might
guzzle what Wine they please, the stink of it will
spread far and near, and profane all; yea, the <i>Mussulmen</i>
themselves, when they came to us, would
return belching out the smell of Wine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hereupon</span> we were likely to be cast in our
Cause; but at last a more favourable Judgment
went for us. That the sudden change would be
intolerable, and occasion many Diseases if not Death
itself. Whereupon we were allowed the freedom of
one Night, to get in what Wine we could, which
was brought to the nearest Landing-place, from
whence we were furnished with Horse-Carriage to
convey it to my Lodging with as little Observation
as might be, all being done in the Night. Thus I
stor’d myself, and kept my Priviledge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> of the <i>Grecians</i> play’d a pretty prank
with the Sultan on this Account. When they knew
that he was to pass through a Road full of Vineyards
on both sides, they set a great many Labourers at
work to root out the Vines; some of them they
laid in the Highway; others they loaded on Carts.
The Emperor passing by, and demanding the Reason
for so doing, they answered, That since by
his Edict they were forbid the use of Wine, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
were cutting down their Vines to make Fuel for
the Fire. For shame, says <i>Solyman</i>, forbear! you
do not understand my Command aright; though I
forbid the use of Wine, yet I allow the eating of
Grapes, as one of the best Fruits that God hath
allotted to Mankind; only you are not to squeeze
out their Juice, and tun it up in Hogsheads, and
so you may make a pernicious use of it. What
will you cut down Apple-trees also, because they
bear not Wine? Get you gone you Buzzards, and
spare your Vines! Thus the <i>Greeks</i> were fool’d in
their Project.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to return to the Story of the Pestilence
which was within the Walls of my House. I went
to <i>Rustan</i> to beg leave for me and my Family to
remove into a less contagious Air; this I desired not
with any great confidence of obtaining my Request,
(for I knew the Rigidness of his Nature,) but only
to shew my care for the Health of my Family.
He told the Messenger, he would acquaint <i>Solyman</i>
with my Desire, and, if I came the next Day, I
should have his Answer. Accordingly I sent and
received this from him; that the Emperor wondered
what I mean in desiring to move my Habitation;
Is not the Pestilence God’s Arrow, which will
always hit his Mark? If God would visit me herewith,
how could I avoid it? Is not the Plague,
said he, in my own palace, and yet I do not think
of removing? And so I was forced to stay in a
Pestilential and Infected House.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>Rustan</i> died of a Dropsy soon after, and
<i>Haly</i>, then Second Vizier succeeded him. He was
a prudent and courteous Person as any was among
the <i>Turks</i>. I sent him a Present, a large Garment
of Silk, by way of Congratulation upon his new
Dignity. He returned me this obliging Answer,
That he would always be my Friend, and upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
any occasion I should not scruple to make my Address
to him. And I found him as good as his Word;
for, when my House a while after was re-visited with
the Plague, which swept away many of my Servants,
and amongst others, my chief Physician; I sent the
same Message to <i>Haly</i> which I had done to <i>Rustan</i>
before; who answered me, for his part he was very
willing I should remove my Habitation; but that it
were better for me to ask leave of the Sultan himself,
lest, said he, if he casually light upon any of your
Servants walking at random up and down, he should
take it very ill that so much liberty was granted them
without his knowledge: And yet, proceeded he, I
shall propose the matter so cautiously to the Prince,
that I do not doubt of his Assent. And accordingly,
soon after I received a Message from him, that I
might remove whither I pleased. Whereupon I
chose an Island called <i>Principo</i>, for my Dwelling,
about four Hours Sail from <i>Constantinople</i>. It was
the pleasantest of all the little Isles contiguous to that
City, for the rest have no Village at all in them, or
but one at most; but this has two.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Physician, I lately told you died at my
House of the Plague, was my old Friend Dr. <i>Williams</i>,
the Faithful Companion of my long and tedious
Pilgrimage. The occasion of the Sickness
was this: It seems, among the rest of the Prisoners
I had redeemed, one, as the Event declared, who
was sick of the Plague. My Physician constantly attended
him, till he got the Infection himself. He
had that Angularity of Opinion, that there was no
more Fear than Danger; for at the same time, said
he, there are wont to arise other Diseases, which
Men are apt to think is the Pestilence; so that
Pestilential Remedies are usually applied to every
common Sore or Boyl. Thus he flattered himself,
even when he was deeply infected; yet he did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
suspect it to be the Plague, till it was past Remedy,
and he was ready to die under the Hands of his Attendance.
The Day before he died, he sent me
word he was better; and desired to see me, if I
pleased to bestow a Visit upon him. I did so, and
sat a great while by his Bed-side. He told me how
very ill he had been, and that his Sight, as well as
his other Senses, had been so weakened, that he
knew no body; but now, said he, my Senses are
restored, and if I could be freed from a Distillation
that almost stops my Breath, I should presently be
well; and at my Departure, I told him, I heard
he had a Tumour in his Breast. I have so, says
he; and thereupon he threw aside his Blanket, and
shewed me his Breast: But there is no Danger, says
he, in it; for it came from buttoning my Doublet,
which I put on too strait. Towards the Evening,
according to custom, I sent two of my Servants to
watch with him, and while they were putting on
him a clean Shirt, he himself espied a Purple Spot
in his Breast, which they told him was but a Flea-bite;
and by and by he discovered more Spots and
larger ones. No, said he, there are not Flea-bites,
but Tokens of near approaching Death; and therefore
us spend this Night in Prayer and holy Conference
preparatory to my latter end; which he did,
and in the Morning, with full assurance of God’s
Mercy, he departed this Life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Thus</span> was I bereaved of my dearest and most
useful Friend, and the Common-wealth of Learning
had also a great Loss of him; for he had made many
curious Observations in his Travels which he intended
to publish, and would have been very useful to
the World, if Death had not prevented his laudable
Designs. His Skill and Faithfulness was so much
prized by me, that, if the Times had differed me to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
return, I knew none fitter to leave in my place at
<i>Constantinople</i> than himself, had he out-lived me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> his Death, my Cares seemed to be
doubled; nay, if I should have left him behind, I
had returned but half myself, as it were. Well!
his Soul is at Rest, and I erected a Monument, as
a due testimony to his Vertue. But to return to our
Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> lived there very pleasantly for three Months.
It was a private Place, without any Crowd or Noise.
There were only a few <i>Greeks</i>, with whom I diverted
myself; but never a <i>Turk</i> to interrupt my Mirth.
As for the <i>Turks</i> of my Houshold, they created no
trouble to me; I might go whither I would, and
pass from one of these Islands to another at my pleasure,
without any molestation from them. There
grew several sorts of Plants, as <i>French</i> Lavender,
sharp-pointed Myrtle, Cotton-weed, and abundance
more. The Sea is full of divers sorts of Fishes,
which I took sometimes with Net, sometimes with
Hook and Line. Several <i>Grecian</i> Fishers with their
Boats attended me, and where we had hopes of the
greatest sport, thither we sailed and cast our Nets.
Sometimes we played above board, and when we
saw a Crab or a Lobster at the bottom, where the
Sea was very clear, we ran him through with a Fish-spear,
and so halled him up into a Vessel. But our
best and most profitable sport, was with a drag-Net;
where we thought most Fish were, there we cast it
in a round; it took up a great compass, with the
long Ropes tied to the ends of it, which were to
draw it to Land. To those Ropes the Seamen tied
green Boughs very thick, so that the Fish might be
frightned, and not seek to escape. Thus we brought
great Sholes of trembling Fishes near the Shore.
And yet in this danger they were naturally instigated
how to save themselves; some would leap over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
the Net, others would cover themselves in the Sand,
that they might not be taken; others strove to bite
the Meashes of the Net, though made of coarse Flax
or Hemp, of which kind were the <i>Synodontes</i>, Fish
armed with strong Teeth; and if one made way for
himself, all would follow him, and so the whole
Draught would escape, and not a Fish left for the
Fisher. To remedy this Inconvenience, (for I was aware
of it) I stood with a Pole in my Hand, beating
the Water, that I might keep the Fish from biting
the Net. At which my Attendants could not choose
but laugh; yet, for all this, many of them escaped:
So sagacious are Fishes where they are in extream
danger! But notwithstanding the Fugitives, we
brought a great many Fishes ashore, a Sea-Bream,
Scorpion-Fishes, Dragon-Fishes, Scare-Fish, Jule-Fish,
Chane or Ruff-Fish, whose Variety did delight
my Eye, and the enquiry into their Nature, did
hugely please my Fancy: So that at Night I return’d
home with my trimphant Vessel laden with Prey.
The next Day I presented <i>Hali Bassa</i>, and his Chief
Steward, with Part of what I had taken, who
thought it a very acceptable Present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sometimes</span> I took delight, with an Iron Spear
made on purpose, to bring up Shrimps or Cramps,
which are there so thick, as if that Sea were stock’d
with them. Where I observed the Master-Shrimps
lying two by two, the Male and the Female, and
sometimes more of them, of which <i>Cicero</i>, <i>Pliny</i>,
and <i>Athenæus</i> speak so much. I confess, I think
some of these Relations concerning them are rather
fabulous than true: For they say, that this Shell-Fish
doth gape in order to catch other small Fishes;
and when she hath got them, yet she shuts not her
Shell till the <i>Pinncphylax</i> bite it, and by this warning
she closes her Shell, and divides the Prey with the
<i>Pinncphylax</i>. The Figure of these <i>Pinnæ</i> you have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
in <i>Bellonious</i>. The sharp part of it sticks in the bottom
of the Sea, as if it grew there; and by these
sticking Fibres, she draws in her Nourishment; as
appears by this, that when she is loosed from her
hold, she dies for want of Sustenance, as Herbs and
Plants do. And it is probable, that the <i>Pinnophylax</i>
chose this sort, as a Defence against other ravenous
Fishes, where it may lye quiet even in stormy
Weather, and go in and out at her pleasure. Yet
I speak not this, to detract from the Credit of those
worthy Authors I mentioned before; but only to
leave the matter to more curious Enquirers. We
quickly laded our Boat with these <i>Pinnæ</i>; they are
but coarse Fare, like Muscles, of which you would
be soon weary; but the Fishermen advised me to
keep the <i>Pinnophylaxes</i> apart, for they are a grateful
and nourishing Food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Amongst</span> the rest of the Islands, there is one
untilled and uninhabited, whither all sorts of Monsters
do resort, Star-Fish, Saw-Fish, Grape-Fish,
Sea-Horses, prodigious Cockles, a round yellow
Fish like an Orange; no ordinary Fish there, but
Thornback, and a certain Fork-Fish, with a terrible
Prickle. I remember, we took one of them,
who, making at us, ran herself through.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> tempestuous Weather kept me from Sea,
I delighted myself in finding out strange and unusual
Plants at Land. I would sometimes go a-foot all
ever the Island, having a young <i>Franciscan</i> Monk
in my Company, a jolly Fellow, but very Fat,
and not used to travel on Foot. I took him out of
a Monastry at <i>Pera</i>, to be my Partner in my Walks;
he was so corpulent and pursy, that when I went on
a-pace to catch myself a Heat, he would follow me
at a Distance panting and blowing, with these
Words in his Mouth, What need all this haste?
Whom do we run from, or whom do we pursue?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
What are we Carriers or Posts that must make speed
to deliver some important Letters? Thus he mutter’d,
till the very Sweat pierced through all his
Cloaths. In fine, when we came back to our Lodgings,
he threw himself upon his Bed, wofully complaining,
and crying out, he was undone: What
Injury have I done, said he, that you thus hurry
on to destroy me? And, in this fretting Posture,
we had much ado to persuade him to eat a bit of
Dinner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> and then, some Friends visited from
<i>Constantinople</i>, and from <i>Pera</i>; yea, and some
<i>Germans</i> also of <i>Holy</i>’s own Family; of whom
when I asked whether the Plague was abated?
Mightily, said they. How many then die in a Day?
Scarce Five Hundred, said they. Good God! quoth
I, call you that to abate? when then doth it rage?
They replied, when about a Thousand or Twelve
Hundred die in a Day. The <i>Turks</i> entertain this
Opinion concerning the Pestilence, that every Man’s
Destiny is written by God in his Forehead; so that
’tis a foolish thing in them, to think to decline or
avoid it. This Opinion makes them fearless of the
Plague, but not secure from it: So that, as soon as
any Man dies of the Pestilence, they will take off
their Cloaths, yet sweaty, and Linnen, and rub
their Faces with them. If it be the Will of God,
say they, that I shall die this way, it will most
certainly come to pass; if not, it will not hurt me.
Thus a large Field is open for Infection; so that
whole Families are sometimes swept away by that
Disease. Whilst I abode in these Islands, I got acquaintance
with one <i>Metrophanes</i>, a <i>Metropolitan</i>
who presided over a Monastry in <i>Chalcis</i>, one of
those Islands. He was a Learned and a Vertuous
Man, very desirous of an Agreement between the
<i>Latin</i> and the <i>Greek</i> Churches; so that he differed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
from the Humour of the rest of the <i>Grecians</i>, who
esteem the <i>Latins</i> as Men of an impure and profane
Sect. So much doth every Man abound in his
own Sense!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I had lived about two Months in those
Islands, some of the <i>Bashaws</i> began to suspect my
long Absence, and told <i>Haly</i>, that perhaps I might
make my escape, for I had Ships ready at my command,
and other Conveniences might easily be procured;
and therefore it was more advisable I should
return into the City. He answered them, he had
that Confidence in my Word, that he believed I
designed no such thing: Nevertheless he sent a <i>Chiaux</i>
to advertise me thereof. The <i>Chiaux</i> very
cunningly pried about, to see if he could discover
the least Preparation for an Escape but finding
none, after I had made him a Present, he returned
to his Master with his Message from me, that he
might rest secure, for I never intended to break my
Word. Thus I continued three Months in my
Retirement, and returned of my own accord into
the City without any Compulsion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> that time forward l had a Familiarity with
<i>Haly</i>, and our Discourse was still of Peace. He is
a <i>Dalmatian</i> by Birth, and only Courteous Man
I found in that barbarous Country: His Nature,
mild and gentle; his Person of easy Access; he is
of a deep Understanding, capable of managing the
greatest Affairs, having much skill in Military
as well as Political Matters, for he is an old Man,
and hath passed through the greatest Offices of that
Common-wealth. His Stature is tall, and his
Countenance filled with a lovely Gravity. He hath
a mighty Love for his Master, and consults by all
means imaginable his Repose in his Old and Sickly
Age. What <i>Rustan</i> thought to do by Austerity,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
Severeness and menacing Expressions, <i>Haly</i> endeavours
to compass by Mildness, Moderation
and Friendship. <i>Rustan</i> was always severe, fierce,
self-will’d; his Word must pass for a Law. ’Tis
true, he knew well enough his own Circumstances,
and what the Times did exact of him, and what
the Old Age of his Prince required; but he was
afraid, that, if he shew’d any Indulgence, either
by Word or Deed, it would be said he did it out
of Covetousness, of which his Prince did much
suspect him: And therefore, though he was desirous
of a Peace, he would abate nothing of his
usual Stiffness; but if Propositions were offered to
him, not pleasing to his Fancy, he was ready to
thrust a Man out of Doors; so that I scarce ever
parted from him but in an angry Mood. One
time, when I was treating with him of Peace, if I
had nothing else to say, he bid me <i>be gone</i>: I presently
rose up and went my way, only telling him,
<i>That I could propose no other Conditions than what my
Master commanded me to do</i>. Which Words I
pronouncing with more Fervour and Passion than
I was wont to do, he called back my Interpreter
and asked him, whether I were angry? He answered,
<i>No: What</i>, said he, <i>if I should obtain
what he desires of the <span class="antiqua">Sultan</span>, dost thou think he
will perform his Word to me, in presenting me
with the Sum he promised me?</i> <i>No question</i>, said
the <i>Drugger-man</i>, <i>but he will be as good as his
Word to a Tittle.</i> <i>Then</i>, says <i>Rustan</i>, <i>go home
and ask him.</i> I had then 5000 Ducats, which
make 6000 Crowns, lying by me for any sudden
Emergency; I loaded my Interpreter with them,
and bid him carry that to <i>Rustan</i> and tell him,
that this Sum was only an Earnest of what I
had promised him; but the rest would follow,
if my Negotiation were brought to an happy Issue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
for by no means would I be worse than my
Word. He seem’d to be pleased with the sight
of the Money, but returned it again to me,
bidding my <i>Drugger-man</i> tell me, that he no
ways doubted of my Faithfulness, but the matter
of the Peace stood yet on ambiguous Terms;
neither could he certainly promise a good Issue,
for he did not fully know his Master’s Mind.
<i>But let the Ambassador</i>, said he, <i>keep it for me,
as my Treasurer, till he sees the Event.</i> Thus
was the Money brought me back again, and
<i>Rustan</i> died soon after.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> give me leave to acquaint you with the
Bounty of my Master, the best of Emperors;
for that Money lying dead by me, I acquainted his
Imperial Majesty, that I would lay it out for one
Year’s Expence (which amounted to just so much)
in my Embassy. But I repented afterwards of this
my Frankness; especially considering what Pains
I had taken in my Employment for so many Years
together. My Mind gave me I was deficient to my
self, in not desiring that Sum for my self, since I knew
I serv’d a liberal Master, who put a just Value upon
every Man’s Service, and rewarded him accordingly;
and therefore I might have desired that Money
(which was snatch’d, as it were, out of the Fire)
for my own use; for I knew some Courtiers
would have asked greater Sums for less Merit and
Service. Upon second Thoughts, I put my
Master in mind of my over-sight, and desired his
Favour, that the said Sum might be returned entire
to me. He was graciously pleased to grant my
Request, and commanded so many Ducats to be
told out for me from his own Exchequer:
Which Bounty of his, so freely bestowed, if I should
be unmindful of, I were not worthy to live a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
Day longer: But to return from whence I digressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Haly</i></span> and <i>Rustan</i> were of quite different Humours
and Dispositions: <i>Haly</i> lived a blameless Life,
free from Sordidness, and never feared that his
courteous Deportment would procure him the
<i>Sultan</i>’s Ill-will; but <i>Rustan</i>, on the contrary,
was a Money-monger, Avaritious, and his
Conscience hing’d at his Purse-strings. <i>Rustan</i>’s
Conferences with me were very short and concise;
but <i>Haly</i> would spin out Time on purpose; and,
that he might entertain me the longer, he would
season his Discourse with a great deal of Facetiousness;
insomuch that the <i>Turks</i>, who attended on
the account of Business or otherwise, would murmur
and grumble that he spent so much Time with
me, thereby they had not convenient Opportunity
to transact their own Concerns with him. And
the Truth is, there was somewhat of Mortification
to my self in it too; for I usually was sent for
to him in the Afternoon, and I went Fasting,
that I might be readier to deal with so acute a Man.
In our Conferences he pressed this as a principal
Point, that each of us would propose that which
we thought most conducive to the service of our
respective Masters. He knew his Master desired
Repose in his old Age, which was sated with
Success and Victory; and he thought my Master
also desired Peace and Quietness; and therefore,
if he studied the Tranquillity of his Realm, he
should by no means rouse a sleeping Lion. <i>The
minds of Princes</i>, says he, <i>are like Looking-glasses
having no innate Shape, yet the Shapes of all Objects
pass through them; so Princes Souls, free of themselves,
are impress’d by the Images of all Things,
as they are represented; and therefore we must lay
nothing before them, but what stands to their Reason:
For as good Cooks temper their Sauces, not to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
this or that Man’s Palate, But for the Relish of all
the Guests; so we, in Propositions of Peace, must
weigh Circumstances on either side.</i> This, and
much more, did he frankly communicate to me;
yea, at all times he shewed himself courteous, and
when I required his Courtesy with any extraordinary
piece of Respect, he thought himself doubly
oblig’d. Once, as he was returning from the
<i>Divan</i>, and came to a cross way where he was
wont to salute his Fellow <i>Bashaws</i> at parting, turning
his Horse too nimbly, and leaning on his Neck,
both Horse and Man fell to the Ground: When
I heard of his Mischance, I sent to know whether
he had got any hurt by his Fall? He returned me
Thanks, and told me, he got no hurt, but ’twas
usual for an old Soldier to be apt to stumble and
fall. Then, turning to the By-standers, <i>This
Christian Agent</i>, says he, <i>has, I thank him, a
mighty Love for me.</i> Sometimes in Discourse he
would tell me, that he had got Wealth and Honour
enough; so that now he studied only to
leave a savoury Memory behind him, by doing
good to Posterity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> our Treaty of Peace had proceeded on
fairly a long time, and I was in good Hopes of a
happy Conclusion, an unlucky Accident happened,
which might have embarrassed the whole Affair:
A certain <i>Greek Despote</i>, by the help of <i>Cæsar</i>’s
Soldiers which guarded the Frontiers of <i>Hungary</i>,
had broke into <i>Moldavia</i>, and driven out the <i>Vaivode</i>
thereof, possessing it for himself. This Business
gave a great Alarm to the <i>Turks</i>, as not knowing
but such Beginnings might end in greater Mischief;
and indeed the Danger was considerable,
though the <i>Turks</i> thought it Prudence to dissemble
their Forces. <i>Haly</i> intended to speak with me about
it, as I understood by one of his Domesticks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
and accordingly he sent for me a few Hours after.
I confess I was somewhat startled at the Message;
I was afraid, that, my Negotiation being in a
promising way to a good Issue, this Matter would
spoil all. When I came, he entertain’d me with
his usual Courtesy, and after much Discourse tending
to a conclusion of the Peace, he shew’d no
sign of Discontent at all in his Words or Looks,
till I was just going to take my leave of him, and
then he bid me sit down again, for something was
come to his Memory which he had forgot: <i>Don’t
you hear</i>, said he, <i>that your <span class="antiqua">Germans</span> have made
an Inroad into <span class="antiqua">Moldavia</span>?</i> <i>No</i>, said I, <i>neither do
I believe it; for how should the <span class="antiqua">Germans</span> come to a
Place so very remote from them as <span class="antiqua">Moldavia</span>?</i> <i>’Tis
most certainly true</i>, said he; <i>I have it by several
Expresses, and I will send one of your own Countrymen
to convince you.</i> This Onset gave me occasion
to tell him, that, if any of this were true, I
was sure it was not done by the command or consent
of my Master <i>Cæsar</i>. <i>The <span class="antiqua">Germans</span></i>, said I,
<i>are a free People, and used to serve other Nations
in their War; and perhaps some of them had taken
Pay under Foreigners: But, in my Judgment,
the cause of these Commotions arises from the
<span class="antiqua">Hungarian</span> Nobles of that Neighbourhood, who
being provoked by the daily Injuries of the <span class="antiqua">Turks</span>,
resolve to be even with them. And, to speak the
Truth, I think they are not much to be blamed, if
upon so great Provocations, they labour to revenge
themselves. Do not your Soldiers take the same Liberties
on the Borders of <span class="antiqua">Hungary</span>? What Plunderings
and Devastations have they not made in the
Emperor’s Territories there! Here we talk of Peace;
there is nothing but War and Bloodshed: And, for
my own part, I am held as a Prisoner, neither do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
my Friends know whether I am alive or dead?
And truly they that have long suffered so much Damage
from you, are worthy rather of Praise than
Blame, if they take any opportunity of Revenge.</i>
<i>Let them retaliate</i>, said <i>Haly</i>, <i>provided it be within
<span class="antiqua">Hungary</span>, and the Borders of it; but ’tis intolerable
they should range as far as <span class="antiqua">Moldavia</span>, which
is but ten day’s Journey from <span class="antiqua">Adrianople</span>.</i> To
which I replied, <i>Men of the Sword do not much
study points of the Law or Civility, but use to take
the first Opportunity to revenge themselves where-ever
it was offered.</i> Thus I departed from him,
neither did he seem at all to be angry, nor
was a jot more morose in my After-addresses to
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> these Transactions with the Vizier,
the <i>French</i> Ambassador did me a great Favour;
there were thirteen young Gentlemen (some
of whom were <i>Germans</i>, and some <i>Hollanders</i>) in
prison at Constantinople upon this remarkable occasion.
They took Ship at <i>Venice</i>, in a Vessel
every Year carried Pilgrims to <i>Jerusalem</i>, under
Protection; some of them travelled on the account
of Religion, others to see foreign Countries:
but they all met with an unlucky Omen; for just
at the time they landed in <i>Syria</i>, the Knights of
<i>Malta</i> had landed some Soldiers, and plunder’d
the Sea-Coast of <i>Phœnicia</i>, carrying away some of
the Inhabitants Prisoners: Whereupon those <i>Syrians</i>
who had lost Parents, Children and Friends,
having no other visible way of Satisfaction, seiz’d
on these Gentlemen in the <i>Venetian</i> Vessel, pretending
they were some of the Pyrates; and if
they did not procure their Friends to be released,
they should be kept in Slavery themselves: And
though they were shewed the Privilege from the
Government of <i>Venice</i>, and were put in mind of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
the Public Faith, and the League betwixt them,
yet all was one, away they must be sent Prisoners
to <i>Constantinople</i>: And their Youth was a great
Prejudice to them, for the <i>Bashaws</i> thought such
young Striplings would never undertake so long a
Voyage on the account of Religion, for the <i>Turks</i>
never begin their Pilgrimage till they are well in
Years.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I heard of this Disaster, I did what I
could to release them, but all to no purpose. The
<i>Bailo</i> of <i>Venice</i> was applied to, because under the
Protection of that Republick they fell into this
Danger: He granted there was all the reason in the
World they should be released; <i>But what Justice</i>,
said he, <i>can we obtain among such an inhuman
and barbarous People?</i> In the mean time I applied
all the Relief I was able, to their distressed Condition:
But one day, far beyond my Expectation,
they all came to my House, and told me, they
were sent as a Present to me by the <i>French</i> Ambassador,
who had obtained their Liberty. I was
mighty glad of their Releasement, and sent great
Thanks to the Ambassador, whose Name was
<i>La Vigne</i>. The manner was thus; when he was
about to take his leave of the Sultan, and to kiss
his Hand, as the Custom is, he thrust a piece of
Paper into it, wherein he desired that the Gentlemen
might be released in favour to his Prince,
because their Voyage was occasioned upon the account
of a Pilgrimage for Religion. <i>Solyman</i>
granted his Request, and released them presently:
Whereupon I supplied them with Accommodations
for their Voyage, and sent them first to
<i>Vienna</i>, and then home into their own Country.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> <i>La Vigne</i> at first was very strict and
vexatious to me, and used all his Arts to bring me
into the <i>Bashaws</i> Dislike without any Fault of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
mine: He told them, I was a Subject to the King
of <i>Spain</i>, born in the <i>Low-Countries</i>, and that I
served the <i>Spaniard</i> more than the Emperor; that
I acquainted him with every thing that was done
at <i>Constantinople</i>, and had Emissaries in Pay, who
related to me the very Secrets of that Empire,
amongst whom was <i>Ebrahim</i> the chief <i>Druggerman</i>
of <i>Turkey</i>. This he did, before the Peace
was made between <i>Spain</i> and <i>France</i>; but,
when those two Princes were agreed, he took
the first opportunity to retract what he had
spoken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>La Vigne</i></span> was a Man of a prodigious Liberty
of Speech; he would tell all he knew, let it be
taken how it would. This made <i>Rustan</i> himself
to avoid his Company; whilst at the same time
others were backward to converse with <i>Rustan</i>,
because of the sourness of his Humour. He sent
once to <i>Rustan</i> to desire Audience: He told the
Messengers, his Interpreters, that he might send
his Errand by them, for his Business might be as
well done in his Absence as in his Presence. Yet
<i>La Vigne</i> would needs come himself, where he
spoke that which grated <i>Rustan</i>’s Ears. <i>What do
you think</i>, says he, <i>that you have got <span class="antiqua">Buda</span>, <span class="antiqua">Gran</span>,
<span class="antiqua">Alba Regalis</span>, and other <span class="antiqua">Hungarian</span>Towns, from
the Christians by Force? No, I deny it utterly;
’tis our Dissention that gave you Opportunity to
take them: If there had not been continual Wars
between the Kings of <span class="antiqua">France</span> and <span class="antiqua">Spain</span>, you would
have been so far from possessing those Towns, that
<span class="antiqua">Charles V.</span> would hardly have suffered you to live
quiet at <span class="antiqua">Constantinople</span> it self.</i> At which Speech
<i>Rustan</i> was so provoked, that he told him, <i>What
dost thou tell me of the Kings of <span class="antiqua">Spain</span> and <span class="antiqua">France</span>?
If all the Christian Princes join their Arms together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
against my Master, he cares not a Rush; he
will easily conquer them all.</i> And thereupon he
withdrew himself into his Bed-chamber, and bid
the Ambassador be gone. I must needs acquaint
you, in this place, with the Relations I have
heard concerning that People which inhabit the
<i>Tauric Chersonese</i>, who are reported to have been
originally <i>Germans</i>, as their Speech, Manners
and Countenances seem to declare. I had a great
desire to meet with any body of that Nation,
from whom I might procure some Tracts written
in that Language, but I could not obtain it; yet
at last I met with an Accident which in part satisfied
my Desires. There came two Envoys from
that Nation to the Sultan, to make some Complaint
or other; and my Interpreters lighting
upon them, did (as I had desired them, if ever
they had Opportunity) invite them to Dinner to
my House. One was a tall Man, carrying an
ingenuous Simplicity in his Countenance, so that
he seemed either a <i>Flemming</i> or a <i>Batavian</i>: The
other was shorter, of a well-set Body, and
browner Colour, a <i>Greek</i> by Birth, but by frequent
Commerce with that People, he had got
much of their Language, and seemed to forget
his own. Being asked concerning the Nature
and Manners of that People, he answered very
pertinently, that they were a warlike Nation,
that inhabited many Towns thereabouts, from
whence the Cham of <i>Tartary</i>, when he pleased,
used to draw forth 800 Musketeers, the chief
Prop of his Army. Their chief Cities were two,
one called <i>Mancup</i> the other <i>Scivarin</i>. He added
much more concerning the Tartars and their Barbarity;
yet he confessed that there was some
very ingenious Men amongst them. If you
asked of the highest Affairs, they would answer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
briefly, yet very much to the purpose. Insomuch,
that the <i>Turks</i> said frequently and justly of them,
that <i>other Nations had their Learning in their
Books, but the <span class="antiqua">Tartars</span> had eaten their Books, and
had their Wisdom in their Breasts, from whence
they could draw it out as they had occasion, as Divine
Oracles.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> are slovenly in their Deportment; for,
if you set any Soop before them, they eat it not
with a Spoon, but with the hollow of their Hands.
Their Meat is Horse-flesh; not roasted, but
heated under the Saddles of their Horses, to
which Hunger was their best Sauce.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Their</span> Prince is served in Silver, his first
and last Dish being a Horse’s Head, as Butter is
served up first and last with us. He repeated
many <i>German</i> Words, amongst others, which
were unintelligible to us; perhaps his Memory
fail’d him, so that he mix’d home-bred and foreign
Words together; to every Word he added
the Article <i>Tho</i> or <i>The</i>. The Words which

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> these People be <i>Goths</i> or <i>Saxons</i>,
I cannot tell; If <i>Saxons</i>, then, I suppose, they
were transplanted thither in the time of <i>Charles</i>
the Great, who dispersed that Nation into many
remote Countries, as appears by the Cities of
<i>Transilvania</i>, which to this day are inhabited by
<i>Saxons</i>; and possibly he might transplant the rest
of the Nation as far as <i>Tauric Chersonese</i>, where
they still retain the Christian Religion, though surrounded
by the Enemies of it: But if they are <i>Goths</i>,
then I judge they chose their Inhabitants there
next to the <i>Getes</i>, and perhaps most of that
Tract of Land between the <i>Gothick</i> Isle and
<i>Procopia</i>, (as now ’tis called) was heretofore inhabited
by <i>Goths</i>. Hence we read of the Names
of sundry <i>Goths</i>, as <i>West-Goths</i>, and <i>East</i> or
<i>Ostro-Goths</i>, who over-ran the World with their
Victory, and were the great Seminary of Multitudes
of Barbarians. This is all I could hear of
these <i>Procopiensians</i> concerning the <i>Tauric Chersonese</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> me now tell you something of the City
and Country of <i>Cathay</i>, which I learned of a certain
<i>Turkish</i> Pilgrim, who use to travel over the
World on account of Religion, and to worship
God on high Mountains and desert Places. He
had travelled over a great part of the East-Country,
where he was acquainted with the <i>Portuguese</i>;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
but, having a desire to visit <i>Cathay</i> also, he joined
himself to some Merchants, who in great Numbers
used to travel to this Country. ’Tis a Journey
that not many will undertake, it being so
dangerous, and the way thither so full of strange
Nations, who use to plunder Travellers in their
passage. When he left <i>Persia</i> behind him, he
came to <i>Samarchand</i>, to <i>Borchar</i>, and to <i>Taschan</i>,
and other Towns inhabited by the Successors
of <i>Tamerlane</i>. When he had passed by these
Places there were large Desarts, and some Countries
inhabited by wild, and others by a more civilized
People; yet the Country was generally
poor, so that they were forced to carry their
Victuals along with them on a drove of Camels:
This Company they call <i>Caravans</i>. After some
Month’s Travel they came to the <i>Streights</i>, entring
into <i>Cathay</i>, (for you must know, that a
great part of that Country is <i>Mediterranean</i>, and
encompassed by such huge Mountains and Rocks,
that it is accessible but in a very few Passages,
where their King hath his Guards and Garrisons).
When the Merchants come thither, they are
asked what they bring? Whence they came?
and how many they are? When the Guard is informed
of the Truth, they make a Smoak by day,
or else kindle a Beacon by night, which gives
warning to the next Beacon, and so from one to
another, till they come to <i>Cathay</i>. This Advice
cost them but some Hours, which otherwise
would take up many Days, the way is so long.
When News is brought to the King, he sends
backward by the same way of Conveyance what
his Pleasure is, whether they shall <i>all</i> be admitted
to enter, or only <i>some</i>, the rest being either excluded,
or made to stay longer. When they are
admitted, they are guarded all along to their several<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
Inns or Lodging-places, where they may have
all things for their Money, till they come to the
King himself. Here every one brings forth his
respective Ware, and offers it the King, whose
Privilege it is, to buy what Ware he pleaseth in
the first Place; and then they sell the rest to the
best Chapman. This they must do within certain
limits of Time, and then they must return;
for the <i>Carthayans</i> cannot endure that Strangers
should live long amongst them, for fear they
should infect their Country-Manners. Thus the
Merchants are dismissed in a very friendly Manner,
and return by the same Stages they went.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Traveller told me, that they were a
very wise People, and lived in good Order and
Government, having a distinct Religion of their
own, differing from the <i>Christian</i>, <i>Jewish</i> or
<i>Mahometan</i>; but nearest to the <i>Jewish</i>, except
their Ceremonies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Printing</span> hath been in use among them for
many Ages, as appears by their several printed
Books: For Paper, they use the Cases of <i>Silk-worms</i>;
it is so thin that it will bear Printing on
one side only, the other is blank. In this City,
he said, there were a great many Shops full of
Musk, which was the fresh foame of a certain
Beast as big as a Kid. A Lion is highly prized
amongst them; there are none of them in that
Country, and therefore they value it at a great
Rate, and will pay well for it. This is what I
could learn of this Wanderer concerning <i>Cathay</i>;
believe it as you please. I asked him further,
whether he had brought back any rare Root,
Fruit or Stone, out of that Country? He told me,
he had brought nothing but a little Root for his
own Use, which he bit and eat a little of, when
he was faint or cold, and it would presently warm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
and relieve him; and thereupon he gave me a
piece of it, telling me I must use it very sparingly:
I desired Dr. <i>Williams</i>, my Physician, then alive,
to taste of it, who, by its biting and inflaming
the Mouth, judged it to be a root of the <i>Wolfleaf-tree</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> me now tell you another wondrous Story
of another wandering <i>Turkish</i> Monk. He wore a
Cap and white Cloak down to his Heels, with long
Hair, such as Painters draw the <i>Apostles</i> with.
He had a promising Countenance, but was a
meer Impostor; and, yet the <i>Turks</i> admired him
as a miraculous Man. My Interpreters were persuaded
to bring him to me, that I might see him.
He dined with me soberly and modesty enough;
afterwards he goes down into the Yard, and upon
his return, he takes up a huge Stone, and struck
with it divers times upon his naked Breast, as many
Blows as would have felled an Ox: Then
he took a piece of Iron, that was heated in the
Fire on purpose, and thrust it into his Mouth,
where he stirred it up and down so that his Spittle
hiss’d again; ’twas a long piece of Iron, thick and
quadrangular in that part which he thrust into his
Mouth, and it was red-hot as a live Coal: Then
he put the Iron into the Fire again, and after I
had made him a Present, he saluted me and departed.
My Domesticks wonder’d at the Trick,
all but one, who pretended he knew more than
all the rest; <i>Oh</i>, says he, <i>he is a meer Cheat</i>;
and thereupon he takes hold of the stronger part
of the Iron, pretending he could do as much as
the Juggler. He had no sooner grasped it in his
Hands, than he threw it away, and his Fingers were
well burnt for his Audaciousness, so that they
were many days a curing. This Accident caused
his Fellows to laugh, and jearingly to ask, whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
the Iron were hot enough yet, and whether
he would touch it again or not?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> same <i>Turk</i>, while he was at Dinner,
told me, that the Prior of their Monastery was a
Man famous for Sanctity and Miracles, for he
would spread his Cloak over a Lake near adjoining,
and sitting on it, would row up and down
whither he pleased: And that he would strip
himself naked, and be tied to a Sheep newly
kill’d, tying Arms to Arms, and Leg to Leg, and
so would be thrown into the hot Oven till the
Sheep were bak’d fit to be eaten, then he himself
would be taken out without any harm at all:
You will not believe this; neither do I, only I
relate what he told me; but that part concerning
the red-hot Iron I saw with my own Eyes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> yet I must tell you, the Matter is not so
much to be admired; for, without doubt, the
Fellow, when he went down into the Yard to
fetch a Stone, had fortified his Mouth, against
the Violence of the Fire, with some such Medicines
as you know are to be met with; for I remember
once in the Market-place at <i>Venice</i>, I saw a
Juggler take melted Lead, and wash his Hands
with it, as if it had been common Water: But
enough of this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> told you before, that I had a little more Freedom
some time before <i>Rustan</i>’s Death, which
was very grateful to me on one Account, because
it gave me an Opportunity to converse with
Strangers and others which frequented my House,
whole Acquaintance might be instructive to me;
and yet this Liberty was not without its Inconvenience;
it gave my Servants opportunity to
straggle abroad, and sometimes without the <i>Janizaries</i>,
and so they met with many Affronts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
which cost me some trouble: I’ll tell you of one, by
which you may judge of the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> of my Servants passed over in a Boat to
<i>Pera</i>; they went alone, either because the <i>Janizaries</i>
were not at home, or else they thought it needless
to take them; one was my Apothecary, the other
Master of my Wine-Cellar. When they had done
what they went for, they hired a Boat to carry them
back to <i>Constantinople</i>; they were scarce sat down in
the Boat, but there came a Youth from the <i>Caddy</i>,
or Judge of that Place, commanding them to come
forth, for the <i>Caddy</i> must be wafted over in that
Boat: My Servants told him, there were Boats
enough to carry over the <i>Caddy</i>, besides that which
they had hired, and therefore they would not stir:
Hereupon he endeavoured to force them; so that
from Words they came to Blows. This being done
in sight of the <i>Caddy</i>, who was coming down to
the Boat, it made him run to help the Boy, (who
was thought to be his <i>Ganymede</i>) but the Steps towards
the Sea being slippery, by reason of Ice, (for
it was Winter) he fell head-long into the Sea, and
had been drown’d if his Companions had not relieved
him: Hereupon a Clamour was raised all over
<i>Pera</i>, and the <i>Turks</i> would have it that my Servants
had laid Violent Hands on the Judge, and had almost
drown’d him. My Servants were seized and
carried before the Judge in Capital Cases: They
fetch out Clubs, and Stocks to put their Feet in,
that they might beat them, as their manner is, on
the Soles of them. In the interim one of my Servants,
an <i>Italian</i>, cried out in a Rage, <i>Beat, strike,
Dogs, strike! we are wronged, we are innocent!
we are Servants to <span class="antiqua">Cæsar</span>’s Ambassador, and doubtless
when your own Emperor shall know how we are abused,
he will make you smart for it</i>. One of the <i>Turks</i>,
hearing him cry out so boldly: <i>D’ye think</i>, said he,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
that One-ey’d thing is a Man? No; for certain, he
<i>is an One-ey’d <span class="antiqua">Cacodæmon</span></i>, (for he had a Blemish
in one of his Eyes.) The <i>Waywode</i> also, that is, in
their Language, the Judge, perceiving the Boldness
of the Man, was at a stand what to do; but thought
it best to send them to <i>Rustan</i>: Thither went the
whole Rout, with a pack of false Witnesses, ready
to give their Testimonies against the Innocent;
for the <i>Turks</i> count it meritorious to give in false
Evidence against a <i>Christian</i>; you need not summon
them to appear, they came of their own accords,
as it happened in this Case: They all cried
out before the <i>Grand Vizier</i>, that those Rogues had
beaten their Judge, and, if they had not been seiz’d,
would have drowned him: My Servants denied the
Crime they were charged with, alledging that they
were falsly accused, and that they were my menial
Servants. By this Time <i>Rustan</i> perceived that there
was more Noise than Truth on his Countrymens
side; yet, to still the Fury of the inraged Multitude,
he told them he would punish them severely; and
he sent them to Prison. The Prison was a Safeguard
to them against the Fury of the Multitude;
he then examined Witnesses, the most credible among
them, and found my Servants were Guiltless,
and that all the Fault lay at the <i>Caddy</i>’s Door. In
the mean time I sent my Interpreters to demand my
Servants; but <i>Rustan</i> thought fit to refer the Matter
to the <i>Divan</i>, lest, if the <i>Sultan</i> should hear of it,
he might suspect, that a Bribe had made him partial
and negligent in the <i>Caddy</i>’s Case. I had at this
time some intimate acquaintance with <i>Haly</i>, to
whom I sent my <i>Druggerman</i> with a grievous Complaint,
that I might not suffer Wrong to the end
of the Chapter; <i>Haly</i> undertook my Cause, and
bid me rest confident that the Business would soon
end to my Satisfaction. But <i>Rustan</i> came not off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
so handsomely; he feared it might be thought that
Money had inclined him more to favour me, and
therefore had rather the Business were made up with
the <i>Caddy</i>; he wished, therefore, I would offer him
a few Ducats to appease him, 25 were enough. I
gave him Thanks for his Advice, and told him,
that if he desired me to throw so many Ducats into
the Sea, I would willingly do it for his sake; but
that Money was not so much to be considered in
this case, as Example: <i>For</i>, said I, <i>if he that did my
Servants an Injury, must be paid for his Labour, a
larger Fund than mine would not suffice; for if a
Man tear his Clothes, while he is intending to do my
People an Injury, he knew where to have Money to
buy new ones, which was an unworthy thing, and by
no means to be indured by me.</i> Thus were my Servants,
by the Mediations of <i>Haly</i> sent home to me.
When the <i>Bailo</i> of <i>Venice</i> heard of their Release,
he sent for one of my Servants present, and desired
to know of him, what that Business had cost me?
<i>Not a Doit</i>, said he. Then said the <i>Bailo</i>, <i>It would
have cost me 200 Ducats before I could have come
off.</i> But the poor Judge suffered most of all; for
he was put out of his Office, the <i>Turks</i> accounting
it an absurd and hainous thing to be beaten by a
<i>Christian</i>, as he confessed he had been.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for the Release of the <i>Spanish</i> Commanders,
it was obtained by my Mediation; they were these,
<i>De Sande</i> Commander of the Land Forces, and
<i>Leyva</i>, and <i>Requesne</i>, the one Admiral of the <i>Neapolitan</i>,
the other of the <i>Sicilian</i> Gallies. In short,
I’ll tell you how I compassed their Release: The
Peace made between the Kings of <i>Spain</i> and <i>France</i>,
did much trouble the <i>Turks</i>, as being inconvenient
to their Affairs, especially considering that they were
not comprehended in it, as at first they thought they
should be; yet they dissembled the matter at present,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
but sought for an Opportunity to shew their
dislike of it. <i>Solyman</i> had writ to the King of <i>France</i>,
that he agreed to the Peace, yet would have him
remember, <i>That Old Friends are not easily made
Enemies, nor Old Enemies, Friends</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Disgust of the <i>Turks</i> was of no small Advantage
to my Affairs: To which <i>Haly Bassa</i>’s Affection,
and <i>Ebrahim</i>’s great desire to shew his Gratitude
to me, did very much contribute.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">You</span> may remember, I told you before, that,
when <i>La Vigne</i> did accuse me to the <i>Bashaw</i>, at the
same time he forgot not <i>Ebrahim</i>, but told them,
that he discovered all the secret Counsels of the <i>Turks</i>
to me. This <i>Ebrahim</i> was the chief <i>Druggerman</i>,
(<i>i. e.</i> Interpreter of <i>Solyman</i>) a <i>Polander</i>, and therefore
more hated by <i>La Vigne</i>, because, in a deadly
Feud with <i>Codognatus</i>, a former Ambassador of the
same King, he seem’d to take <i>Codognatus</i> his part.
I shall not trouble you with the Contest betwixt
them, it being little to my purpose: This is certain,
that <i>La Vigne</i> was mindful of the Affront, and could
never endure <i>Ebrahim</i>; but when he had Access to
the <i>Bashaw</i>, every third Word was against him;
neither did he desist from complaining, till <i>Ebrahim</i>
was remov’d out of his Place. For my part, I was
not much concern’d at <i>Ebrahim</i>’s Disgrace; I had
never such an extraordinary kindness for him, as to
lament his Loss, for I found him many times
thwarting my Affairs; only it troubled me, that
’twas noised abroad, he lost his Place for my sake.
Hereupon, I assisted him in his Privacy what I could;
for I knew it troubled him, to be turned out of his
Office, and therefore I us’d him as an Interpreter or
Messenger, betwixt me and the <i>Bashaws</i> in my
Transactions about the Peace. And <i>Haly</i> admitted
him, out of Respect to me, and because he was degraded
without any just Cause. In short, I never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
rested till I got him restored to his Place; and that
piece of Service did so oblige him, that in Gratitude
he returned me all the good Offices he could, in all
Company, and upon all Occasions: And he had the
greater Opportunity so to do, because of the Offence
the <i>Turks</i> had taken at the <i>French</i>, for making
Peace with the <i>Spaniard</i>. On this Account, when
the Noble <i>Salviatus</i> was sent by the <i>Most Christian
King</i>, to procure <i>de Sande</i>’s Liberty, he was wholly
and absolutely refused. <i>De Sande</i> was in great Expectation
of that Embassy, believing he should never
be released, if that Negotiation did not effect it;
and, therefore, he was at a great Expence in Presents
for the <i>Grand Seignior</i>, and other great Men
upon his Release. All which signified nothing, for
<i>Salviatus</i> went away without doing any thing.
When he was gone, the Servants and Solicitors
of <i>de Sande</i> came to me in a great Fright; and
told me, they durst not acquaint their Master with
the unsuccessful News of <i>Salviatus</i>’s Intercession
for his Liberty; for all his Hopes depending thereon,
they were afraid the Transaction would either make
him desperate, or bring some fatal Disease upon him;
and, therefore, they desired me to acquaint him
first by Writing. I refused, alledging, That I had
not <i>Common Places</i> enough to draw Comfort from,
for a Man in so deep Distress. For <i>de Sande</i> was
a Man of a great Spirit, full of Hope, and without
any Fear; and Men of such Dispositions, hope for
every Thing they desire; and if they meet with
any Disappointment of their Hopes, they are so
cast down, that ’tis hard to raise them to any tolerable
frame of Spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> Matters stood thus at a Hand, in comes
<i>Ebrahim</i>, my Interpreter, very opportunely; and
falling into Discourse about these <i>Spanish Prisoners</i>,
he told me plainly, that if I did but demand their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
Liberty, I should certainly obtain it; and what he
spake was upon good Grounds. He had formerly
given me some blind Hopes, that I might procure
their Release if I set my self about it: But, I gave
little heed to this Suggestion; for not being certain
of a Peace, how could I attempt such a Thing?
Besides, I was afraid, lest my Interposition might
hinder the Success of <i>Salviatus</i>’s Negotiation: But
he was gone, and <i>Ebrahim</i>, whom I had so much
obliged, persisted in the same Opinion. I began to
hearken to him; but told him, he should have a
Care he did not engage me, who was his Friend, in a
ridiculous Business; for, without doubt, I should be
laugh’d at, if I did not succeed in it, the Matter being
thought difficult to be compared in common
Opinion, and <i>Salviatus</i> having attempted it in vain;
yet he advised me to proceed therein, and amused
me with the Assurance of good Success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Upon</span> this Encouragement, I wrote to <i>de Sande</i>,
how fruitless <i>Salviatus</i>’s Embassy had been, yet I
advised him not to despair; for, if any Credit were
at all to be given to a <i>Turk</i>, there was good hope of
his Affairs; and then I related what <i>Ebrahim</i> had
told me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> laid this Foundation, I advised with
some Friends who were well skill’d in <i>Turkish Affairs</i>.
They wish’d me all good Success, but were
very doubtful of it; especially since the King of
<i>France</i>’s Ambassador had been denied, and the Issue
of a Peace was yet undetermined; and moreover,
as the <i>Turks</i> are hardly ever induced to release great
Men; yet I wrote to my Master the Emperor, to
let him know what Hopes I had, and desired that
I might, in his Name, beg the Release of those Prisoners.
In short, upon great Gifts, and fair Promises
made to the <i>Bashaws</i>, for their Favour in this
Case; the Day before St. <i>Laurence</i>’s Day, all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
Prisoners were released and sent to my Lodgings.
<i>De Sande</i> and <i>Leyva</i> were so odious to each other,
that they would not eat together, but I was forced
to spread their Tables a-part; <i>Requesne</i> eat with
<i>Leyva</i>, and <i>de Sande</i> with me. While we were at
Supper, the <i>French Ambassador</i>’s Steward came to
me, with a small Pacquet of Letters. <i>De Sande</i>
ask’d, if he knew him? Yes Sir, said he, I think
you are <i>Don Alvarez</i>. I am so, said he, pray remember
me to your Master, and tell him, that I
have obtained my Liberty by means of the Emperor’s
Ambassador, and that you have seen me Abroad
with your own Eyes. I see you, indeed, Sir,
said he; but so, that I can scarce believe my own
Eyes. <i>De Sande</i> did thus accost him, because his Master,
the <i>French Agent</i>, would never believe that <i>Solyman</i>
would release those great Men at the Emperor’s
Instance: And the Truth is, before they could obtain
their Liberty, their <i>Mufti</i>, who is an <i>Archbishop</i> amongst
the <i>Turks</i>, was consulted, Whether a great
many <i>Turks</i> might not be released for a few <i>Christians</i>;
for I had promised, that about forty <i>Turks</i>,
of an ordinary Rank, who were Prisoners with us,
should be released for them. The <i>Mufti</i> answered,
That there were two Opinions on the Case; one
<i>Pro</i>, the other <i>Con</i>; but he was for the Affirmative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> now remains that I acquaint you with the last
End of <i>Bajazet</i>, who, I told you before, was put
in Prison by the <i>Persians</i>. Many Messages had passed
between those two Princes on that Occasion; and
an Ambassador came once from <i>Persia</i> with Presents,
a Tent curiously wrought, <i>Assyrian</i> and <i>Persian</i>
Tapestry, with the <i>Alcoran</i>, and some Beasts
of an unusual Sort; as, an <i>Indian Ant</i>, as big as
an ordinary Dog; a fierce and biting Present. The
Cause of the Embassy was pretended to be, the Reconciliation
of <i>Bajazet</i> with his Father; and they
were received very honourably, entertained with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
rich Banquets, of which <i>Haly</i> sent me a part;
eight huge Dishes full of Sweetmeats, and plenty
of the richest Wines. ’Twas the Custom of the
<i>Romans</i> to send Dishes from their Feasts to their
Friends; the <i>Spaniards</i> do it to this Day; and the
<i>Turks</i> from their great Feasts carry home something,
especially if they have Wives and Children.
They many times carried home whole
Napkins full of good Bits from my Table; and
tho’ they pretend to Cleanliness, yet they would
sometimes daub their Silk-cloaths with some Collation-drops.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> me tell you a Story to this purpose,
which I know will make you laugh heartily, as
it did me at the first hearing it: For we are not
such <i>Cato’s</i>, but that sometimes we may season our
Care with moderate Laughter, which shews that
we are <i>Men</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> the custom of the <i>Turkish Bashaws</i>, some
Days before their Fast, (which we call <i>Lent</i>) to
make a public Feast or Entertainment for all
Comers, none are excluded; yet generally none
but Servants, Friends, and Relations come. There
is a Napkin made of Leather, spread over a long
Tapestry on the Ground, full of Dishes; the
Table will hold abundance of Guests; the <i>Bashaw</i>
himself sits at the upper end, and the choicest
Guests next to him, and then the ordinary Guests,
in Ranks, till the Table be full. It will not hold
all at once, but some stand by till others have
din’d, which they do with great Decency and
Silence; and then drinking a draught of Honey
diluted with Water, salute their Landlord, and
away they go. In their Places, others sit down,
and a third Class after them; the Servants still
taking off the old Dishes and setting on new. A
certain <i>Bashaw</i> making such a Feast, invited a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
<i>Sinziack</i> to sit next to him; an old Man of the
Sect which the <i>Turks</i> call <i>Hogies</i>, (<i>i. e.</i> Learned
Men) sat next to him. This <i>Hogi</i> seeing such
plenty of Victuals before him, had a mind to carry
home some to his Wife, after he had filled his
own Belly; but looking for his Handkerchief
to fill it with Victuals, he found he had left it
at home; being then in a straight, he bethought
himself, and resolv’d to fill his Sleeve that hang’d
on his Back; but, mistaken the <i>Sinziack</i>’s for his
own, he stuft it full of Dainties, and stops it in
with a piece of Bread that nothing might fall out.
He was not to touch his Sleeve till he had laid
his Hands on his Breast or Thigh, and so saluted
his Entertainer, as their Custom is; when he had
done that, he took up his own Sleeve and finds
it empty, at which he was much amaz’d, and
return’d home very sad. A while after, the <i>Sinziack</i>
also rose from the Table, and having saluted
the <i>Bashaw</i> at every Step, his Sleeve cast
out the Dainties it was replenished with, unknown
to him; and seeing a train of Junkets behind him,
he blush’d for shame. The Company fell a
laughing, but the <i>Bashaw</i> imagining how it
came to pass, desired him to sit down again, and
so he sent for the <i>Hogi</i>, and when he came, he accosted
him thus: <i>I wonder that you, an old Friend,
and having a Wife and Children at home, did carry
home nothing to them, seeing my Table was so
well furnished.</i> <i>Truly, Sir</i>, said he, <i>’twas no
Fault of mine; but of my Evil <span class="antiqua">Genius</span>; for I
stuff’d my Sleeve with Viands, and yet, when I came
out, I found it empty.</i> Thus the <i>Sinziack</i> was
cleared, and the Disappointment of the <i>Hogi</i>,
together with the Novelty of the Case, occasioned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
no small Laughter throughout all the Company.
But to return to <i>Bajazet</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">His</span> Case was desperate, between an <i>angry Father</i>
that required to have him given up, and a
<i>false Friend</i>, who pretended to detain him.
Sometimes <i>Solyman</i> dealt mildly with the <i>Persian</i>,
putting him in mind of the League between
them, that they were to have the same Enemies
and Friends: Sometimes he threaten’d him with
War, if <i>Bajazet</i> were not surrendered; and
thereupon he placed strong Garrisons on all the
Confines of <i>Persia</i>; he filled <i>Mesopotamia</i> and the
Banks of <i>Euphrates</i> with the Soldiers, especially
the Veteran ones, whom he had employed against
<i>Bajazet</i>, over whom <i>Mahomet</i> the third
of the <i>Vizier’s Bashaws</i>, and <i>Beglerbeg</i> of <i>Greece</i>,
was made General, for <i>Selimus</i> was returned
home: Moreover, he solicited the <i>Georgians</i>
dwelling between the <i>Hircan</i> Sea and <i>Pontus</i>,
bordering on <i>Persia</i> to aid him against them:
They answered courageously, That they were
not strong enough of themselves to cope with the
<i>Persian</i>; but if he himself came upon the Place
with an Army, they would then shew themselves
Men of Courage against the <i>Persian</i> as their common
Enemy. The <i>Hircanians</i> also and the Posterity
of <i>Tamerlane</i> were solicitous to join Arms.
<i>Solyman</i> himself gave out, that he would go to
<i>Aleppo</i>, (a City of <i>Syria</i>, seated on the Banks of
<i>Euphrates</i>) that from thence he might make War
on the <i>Persian</i>: Nor was the <i>Persian</i> himself without
Fear; for he had often experienced the Dint
of <i>Solyman</i>’s Sword. But the generality of the
<i>Turks</i> were averse to the War, and look’d on it
as a wicked and detestable one; and this cooled
the <i>Sultan</i>. A great many of the Soldiers, especially
the Horse, forsook their Colours, and return’d<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
to <i>Constantinople</i> without leave of their Officers;
and being commanded immediately to
return, they did so; but so unwillingly, that
<i>Solyman</i> plainly saw their Aversion from the Service.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whereupon</span> <i>Solyman</i>, seeing he could not
get <i>Bajazet</i> alive out of the <i>Persian</i>’s Hands,
(who feared his Revenge, if ever he came off
clear,) thought of the next thing, which was, to have
him strangled there; and he hop’d to obtain his
End this way, because the <i>Persian</i> had lately
acquainted him by Letter, that he had been very
remiss in so great an Affair. I have sent divers
Ambassadors to you, said he, but you send nothing
to me but empty Letters, or Messengers; and
therefore, to convince me that you are real in
the Business, send considerable Ambassadors of
your prime Nobility with whom I may transact,
according to the greatness of the Affair. As for
himself, <i>Bajazet</i> had been a great Charge to him,
before he could be taken, and therefore ’twas fit
an Account should be had of those Expences.
<i>Solyman</i> thereby saw that Money was requir’d,
and therefore by the Advice of his <i>Bashaw</i>, he
resolved to take any other Course, rather than to
involve himself in an unnecessary War with the
<i>Persians</i>. Hereupon <i>Hassan Aga</i>, together with
an old <i>Bashaw</i>, one of the Bed-Chamber, was
sent by <i>Solyman</i> into <i>Persia</i>. They departed with
ample Commission, in the midst of Winter; they
made great haste, insomuch that they lost several
of their Retinue in the way: At last, they came
to <i>Casbia</i> to the <i>Sophia</i>, and desired to see <i>Bajazet</i>;
they found him in a nasty filthy Prison, his Beard
and Hair so long, that till he was shav’d he could
hardly be known; but then <i>Hassan</i> knew him by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the lineaments of his Face, having been brought
up with him from a Child, and therefore he was
chosen as the fittest Person for this Embassy. It
was agreed, that the <i>Persian</i> should be repaid
what he had laid out, and should have many rich
Presents besides, and then <i>Bajazet</i> was to be
put to Death. <i>Hassan</i> returns and gives an account
to his Master, who thereupon sent the Expences
by him, with the Gifts, which were guarded
by the <i>Turks</i> to the Confines of <i>Persia</i>. Thus
<i>Hassan</i> again returned to be the Executioner of
unfortunate <i>Bajazet</i> with his own Hand, for so
<i>Solyman</i> had commanded. When the Bow-string
was about his Neck, he desired but one thing before
his Death, which was, to see his Children,
and to take his last farewell of them, by the only
Thing he had left to give, a parting Kiss; but
that was deny’d. This was the end of <i>Bajazet</i>
and his unfortunate Designs; the way he took to
save himself was his Ruin. His four Children
under-went the same Fate. As for the new-born
Infant which he left at <i>Amasia</i>, whom his Grandfather
had removed to <i>Persia</i> to be educated there,
when his Father was dead, a trusty <i>Eunuch</i> was
sent to <i>Persia</i> to destroy him too; but the <i>Eunuch</i>
being somewhat tender-hearted, procured a certain
Porter, a hard-hearted Fellow, who car’d
not what desperate things he undertook, to dispatch
the Child. This Fellow went into the Room, and
as he was fitting the String to the Child’s Neck, the
poor Infant lifted up its self as well as he could, and
embracing him in his Arms, offered to kiss him;
which did so mollifie his wretched Heart, that he fell
down in a Swoon. The <i>Eunuch</i> stood at the Door,
and wondering at the Delay, went in and found the
Fellow lying flat on the Ground; whereupon he
was forced to execute the Charge himself, and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
strangled the poor innocent Child. By this Passage
it appears, that <i>Solyman</i> spar’d his Nephew hitherto,
not out of any Principle of Mercy, but out of an
Opinion the <i>Turks</i> have, that Matters, if they succeed
well, are pleasing to God; and therefore, as
long as ’twas uncertain, what might be the event of
<i>Bajazet</i>’s Designs, he would not imbrue his Hands
in his Child’s Blood, lest, if <i>Bajazet</i> had succeeded,
he might seem to have resisted the Will of God:
But, when <i>Bajazet</i> was slain, he thought God had
determined the Controversie, and that his Son also
might not be spared, lest the Proverb should be verified,
<i>Of an ill Crow, an evil Egg</i>. I had along Discourse
with my <i>Chiaux</i> upon this Subject, when I was in the
Island before mentioned, and had liberty to sail from
one to the other. It happened once, that as we were
returning in our Skiff, the Wind being against us,
we could not double a Promontary that reach’d pretty
far into the Sea, but were forced to land and take
our Dinner a-shoar; for I always carried ready-dress’d
Provision along with me in the Vessel for fear
of the worst; and their <i>Turks</i> were also forced to
land, by the same Stress of Weather. Our Table
was spread in a green Meadow; my <i>Chiaux</i> and my
Interpreter sate at Table with me. Mention being
occasionally made of <i>Bajazet</i>, the <i>Chiaux</i> began to
inveigh bitterly against him for taking up Arms against
his Brother. I pleaded for him, and said,
he was worthy of Pity, who was forced to do
what he did: There was an inevitable Necessity
upon him, either to submit himself to a certain
Death, or to save his Life by taking Arms. However
the <i>Chiaux</i> persisted still to call it an execrable
Undertaking; whereupon I argued thus; you
accuse <i>Bajazet</i> as guilty of an horrid Offence;
but you acquit <i>Solyman</i>, the Father of your present
Emperor, who took up Arms against his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
Father. We do so, said the <i>Chiaux</i>, and with
Reason; for the Event shew’d, that what he did,
was by God’s Approbation, and predestinated in
Heaven. If you argue from Success, said I, then
the wickedest Fact, if it prosper, may be imputed
to God as the Author; and then he may be made
the Author of Sin, if <i>Good</i> and <i>Evil</i> must be interpreted
only by Events. We dwelt a while on
this Discourse, and were very eager upon it,
whilst either of us defended his own Opinion.
We alledg’d many places of Scriptures; <i>Can the
Vessel say to the Potter, why hast thou made me
thus? I will harden <span class="antiqua">Pharaoh</span>’s Heart: <span class="antiqua">Jacob</span>
have I loved; but <span class="antiqua">Esau</span> have I hated</i>: and others
of like import.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Turks</i>, that were not far from us, wonder’d
what we were so earnest about; and after
we rose from the Table, my <i>Chiaux</i> went to
them. They gathered themselves in a Ring about
him, and I saw them hearkening to the Discourse
he made, with great Attention; and at last, at
Noon, they were all silent, and worshipped God
according to their Custom. I thought it long
till my <i>Chiaux</i> returned to me, that I might know
why he prated so amongst his Comrades; I was
afraid, though I had ever found him a good Man,
that he might represent what I had spoken to him,
to my Prejudice: At last, when the Wind ceased,
we went aboard again, and followed our intended
Course. The first thing I did, was, to ask of
my <i>Chiaux</i>, what serious Discourse he held with
his Country-men? He smil’d, and made me this
Answer: <i>We were disputing about <span class="antiqua">Predestination</span>,
and I told them what you had alledg’d <span class="antiqua">Pro</span> and
<span class="antiqua">Con</span>; by which it was plain, that you had read
our Books, and was well read in the <span class="antiqua">Scriptures</span>,
so that there was nothing wanting to your Happiness,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
but to turn to our <span class="antiqua">Religion</span>, which, in the
Prayers you saw us make, we desired of God.</i>
When News was brought to <i>Constantinople</i> that
<i>Bajazet</i> was dispatched, I was afraid that our
Affairs, which were in a hopeful way of Conclusion,
would now meet with a Rub at last;
the Misfortune of <i>Bajazet</i> might over-turn all,
make the <i>Turks</i> more Insolent, undo what was
done, and propose harder Conditions. I had passed
over some Difficulties, as the Loss of <i>Gerba</i>, and
the Imprisonment of <i>Bajazet</i>, and the <i>Vaivode</i>’s
Expulsion out of <i>Moldavia</i>; but there were two
terrible ones, <i>Bajazet</i>’s Death, and another, which
I shall speak of by and by.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Haly</i></span> sent one of his Domesticks, to tell me,
that <i>Bazajet</i> was dead for certain; that therefore,
I should not defer the Peace, in hopes of his Success:
That I should remember, Princes of the same
Religion are more easily reconcil’d, than those of
contrary ones are; and, therefore, I should hesitate
no longer, nor seek Knots in a Bulrush, as the
Proverb is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> Message troubled me much; yet, because
I thought the Account might not be true, I sent
up and down the Town amongst my Friends,
to know what Certainty they had of <i>Bajazet</i>’s
Death: They all returned me answer, <i>That he was
most certainly dispatched</i>: Whereupon, I resolved to
draw in my Sails; there were no Hopes for me to
obtain better Conditions; it were well, if I could
maintain my Ground, and stick to my former without
any change: The Emperor of the <i>Turks</i> had
seen them, and was not much averse to them; some
small Alterations were made; something I wished
I could have added; other Things were dubiously
expressed, which an ill-natured Interpretation might
raise Scruples about. I did my Endeavour that these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
might be taken out, or corrected, and made more
favourable on our Side. My Master <i>Cæsar</i> had
seen and approved those Conditions; yet still I could
not satisfy my self, till something more favourable
was added. Whilst I was doing this, I was accosted
with <i>Haly</i>’s Message as aforesaid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> met also with another grievous Rub; some
Noblemen of <i>Hungary</i> had revolted from the
<i>Vaivode</i> of <i>Transilvania</i> to the Emperor, that is,
to speak the Truth, had returned to their Duty;
and the Garrisons also, which they commanded,
yielded to <i>Cæsar</i>. This new Accident might have
disturbed all; for the <i>Turks</i> had a specious Pretence
to alledge, That, while Conditions of Peace were
once on foot, such Alteration ought not to have
been made; if Peace were cordially desired, all
Things were to be returned to their pristine State:
but, let Revolters speed as they pleased, what they
had possessed ought to be returned to the <i>Vaivode</i>,
their Client and Vassal. But, <i>Haly</i> was so far from
pressing this, that one express Condition was, that
those Things should be ratified; which he willingly
assented to. But the Ambassadors who came lately
from the <i>Vaivode</i>, were very much troubled at it;
they rub’d upon the gall’d Place, and filled the
whole Court with their Clamours, that their miserable
Matter was deserted, the Law of Allegiance
broken, and Enemies preferred before ancient
Friends. All the rest of the <i>Bashaws</i> were moved
with their Complaints, only <i>Haly</i> stood firm to me,
so that the Articles of the Peace were not altered
at all. For my part, though I knew that the
Terms would be allowed by my Master <i>Cæsar</i>, yet,
because there want not Sycophants in Princes
Courts, who go about to obscure the best Services
of their Ministers, especially if Strangers: I therefore<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
thought it fit to leave all to the Pleasure of my
Master: I told <i>Haly</i>, that, though the proposed
Condition did not fully answer the Expectation of
my Master, I hoped, however, he would acquiesce
therein, if an Agent of theirs were sent along with
me to explain the Things that were obscure, upon
which any Controversy might arise; and that <i>Ebrahim</i>
seemed to be the fittest Man for this purpose,
by whom <i>Cæsar</i> might write back his full Mind
concerning the whole Project; this was easily assented
to. Thus an End was put to a long and tedious
Business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">’Tis</span> a Custom, that when Ambassadors depart
from <i>Constantinople</i> upon fair Terms, the <i>Bashaws</i>
do entertain them with a Feast in the <i>Divan</i>; but
I was willing to wave that Badge of Esteem, because
I would have all left in suspence, and referred
to the good Will and Pleasure of my Master.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> had a mind before my Departure, to buy some
gallant Horses, and therefore, ordered my Servants
to go often to the Markets, to see if they could find
any such. <i>Haly</i> being informed thereof, sent one
of the best of his own Horses to the Fair to be sold;
my Servants had their Eye presently on him, and
asking the Price, they told them 120 Ducats; they
offered 80, not knowing whose it was; but that
was refused. A Day or two after, the same Horse,
with two more quite as good, were sent me by
<i>Haly</i>, for a Present; one was an <i>Arabian</i> ambling
Nag, exceedingly well shaped. When I gave him
Thanks for my noble Present, he asked me, whether
I did not think that Horse which my Servant’s offered
80 Ducats for, was worth more? Yes, a good
deal more, said I; but my Orders were, that they
should not exceed that Price, for fear of losing too
much, in case of any hidden Defect afterwards shew
that I had bought Horses too dear. He advised me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
also, how to manage their <i>Turkish</i> Horses; as that
I should give them but little Meat; that I should
make but short Journeys at first, till they were us’d
to the Roads; and that I should make nine or ten
Days Journey to <i>Adrianople</i>, which used to be performed
in five: He gave me also a curious Veil
wrought with gold, and a Box full of <i>Alexandrian</i>
Treacle, the best in the World; and a Glass full of
Balsam, which last he highly prized, complimenting
me thus: <i>Any other Present</i>, said he, <i>are such as
Money can procure; but this is a rare Gift, that my
Master cannot send a choicer to the best Friend or
Ally he hath. I got it</i>, said he, <i>when I was Governor
of <span class="antiqua">Egypt</span>, which Place I held some Years: There are
two sorts of that juicy Substance; one which is drawn
from the Oil of the decocted Leaves of the Shrub on
which they grow, which is black and not much
worth; the other distils from the Bark of the Tree
when it is cut, which is yellow and genuine; and
mine was of that sort.</i> He desired likewise, that I
would send him some Presents, as a Coat of Mail
fitted to his large and full Body, and a strong
Horse that was sure-footed (for he was so big and
pursy, that no Horse could be easily found, fit to
carry him) and with all kind of varnishing Matter
coming from the <i>Maple</i>, or any other Tree, wherewith
our Artists use to inlay their Tables. As for
<i>Solyman</i>, he gave me no Gifts but common ones,
such as other Ambassadors have had at their Departure,
and such as I received from him formerly at
my Audience of Leave; only he inveighed against
the <i>Heydukes</i>, and the Insolency of the Garrison of
<i>Syeth</i>: To what Purpose, is it, <i>said he</i>, to make
Peace here, if they continue the War thus? <i>I told
him</i>, I would acquaint my Master, and that I did
not doubt, but he would redress it; and, thus by
good Fortune, about the End of <i>August</i>, I entered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
upon my desired Journey, carrying with me a
Truce of eight Years, the Fruits of my eight Years
Abroad there, which may be continued for a longer
Time, unless some considerable Change happens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we came to <i>Sophia</i>, where the Way
parts, one to <i>Rhagusa</i>, the other to <i>Belgrade,
Leyva</i> and <i>Requesne</i> desired me to part Company, and
go to <i>Rhagusa</i>, that so they might more easily pass to
<i>Venice</i> and <i>Italy</i>, and procure those Gifts which they
promised to lend to the <i>Bashaws</i>, and repay the
Money they had borrowed at <i>Constantinople</i>; and
that they would send Letters of Thanks by me to
<i>Cæsar</i>, to give him due Acknowledgments for their
Release: Which Service they would willingly have
performed in Person, if their other Occasions had
not hindered. I easily consented to their Requests,
and was the better pleased, because <i>Requesne</i>, being a
very old Man, died before he came to <i>Rhagusa</i>:
If I had denied their Request, it might have been
thought my Refusal had contributed to his Disease.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>De Sande</i></span> and my self passed the rest of our
Journey without any great Inconvenience; for the
Truth is, he is a very facetious Man, and, if he is
troubled with Grief, he knows how to cover it, and
to pretend Mirth outwardly. In our way, many
diverting Things offered themselves; sometimes we
would alight, and try which of us could run fastest;
I, being lean, could easily out-run him, who was
fat and pursy, and just come out of Prison. When
we came near to a Village, <i>Ebrahim</i> would ride up
to us (for he with his <i>Turks</i> followed gravely on
Horseback) and beseeched us, by all that was dear
to us, not to be seen on foot by the Villagers, for
it would be accounted a Disgrace to us among the
<i>Turks</i>. His Advice made us sometimes get into our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
Chariot again, but the Pleasure of walking afoot still
got the better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of <i>de Sande</i>’s many facetious Sayings, I
must give you. When we came from <i>Constantinople</i>,
the Weather was very hot, and it continued so
sultry all the Way, that it palled my Appetite, and
a very little Food served my Turn; but <i>de Sande</i>,
being a robust healthy Person, eat like a Horse, and
would ever now and then tell me, that I must follow
his Example and eat like a Man of Mettle. Yet, all
his Advice was to no Purpose, till about the Beginning
of <i>October</i>, I drew near to the Borders of
<i>Austria</i>; and there, partly from the Country, and
partly from the Season of the Year, I began to be
more healthy, and to take a larger proportion of
Food.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> <i>de Sande</i> observed that I had a better
Stomach than formerly, he began to triumph over
me exceedingly, boasting that ’twas by his Advice
and Example, that I had learned to eat Meat, and
that I, who was so many Years older, had need of
a Monitor to advise me to take due Sustenance for
my Body; so that if he were obliged to me for his
Release, I was as much beholding to him for teaching
me to recover my Appetite. In these ludicrous
Repartees we came to <i>Tulna</i>, where we met with
some Trouble. <i>De Sande</i> used to lye in the same
House, if it were large enough to hold us both; if
not, he took his Lodgings at some Neighbouring
House, that he might not incommode me. He was
willing to do so at <i>Tulna</i>, and therefore, desired the
<i>Janizaries</i> whom I brought with me from <i>Constantinople</i>
to <i>Buda</i>, to be my Harbingers on the
Way, and to find out a convenient Lodging for him.
One of my Servants a Doctor of Physic, and a
<i>Spaniard</i>, whom <i>de Sande</i> had released at <i>Constantinople</i>
at his own Charge, went along with the <i>Janizaries</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
They happened to go to the House of
another <i>Janizary</i> hard by, who was appointed as
Governor of the Place to guard Passengers; for the
<i>Turks</i> use to appoint one or two <i>Janizaries</i> in every
noted Town to protect <i>Christian</i> Passengers from
Violence; by which Office they get no small Profit:
But this Man, for some Offence or other, had been
put out of his Office, and therefore, was of a very
surly Temper. My People viewed his House, and
not finding it for their Turn, were going away;
the <i>Janizary</i> first, my Servant next, and the Physician
last. In the <i>Interim</i>, the <i>Janizary</i>, Master
of the House, walking in his Garden, was told,
that some <i>Christian</i> Passengers were seeking for a
Lodging at his House: Whereupon, he came in a
great Rage, with a Club like <i>Hercules</i>’s, in his Hand,
and without speaking a Word, strikes the Physician
a great Blow on the Shoulders, as hard as he was
able; the Physician, to avoid a second Blow, ran
out of the House. My Servant, looking back, saw
him lift up his Club to strike him also; but he, having
a Thing like a Hatchet in his Hand, held it
cross-ways over his Head, and so kept off many a
lusty Blow, till at last the Handle of the Hatchet,
by his often stricking, began to break. Then my
Servant was forced to close in with the <i>Janizary</i>,
and was about to cleave his Skull with his Weapon:
Whereupon, the <i>Janizary</i> fled, and my Servant
not being able to overtake him, threw the Hatchet
after him, which cut him in the Hams, and fell’d
him to the Ground; by which Accident, my
People escaped: But the Physician cryed out, that
he was a dead Man, and that all his Bones were
broken in Pieces. <i>De Sande</i> heard his Complaint;
yet, though he was vext, could not choose but
smile, as thinking that the Doctor was more afraid
than hurt: But, that which most tormented him,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
was, lest on this Occasion he should be carried back
to <i>Constantinople</i>: He was of Opinion that the
<i>Bashaws</i> had not dealt sincerely in his Case, but had
made only a Pretence of releasing him to gratify me,
and really sought an Occasion to drag him back
again, to rot in Prison. For the same Cause, he was
much offended with my Servant who had wounded
the <i>Janizary</i>, especially for saying, <i>That he was
very sorry that he had not killed him upon the Spot</i>.
His Words to him were these; <i>Honest <span class="antiqua">Henry</span>,
Prithee be not so Passionate; ’tis no Time nor Place
to shew thy Valour here; we must bear Affronts patiently,
without any just Imputation of Cowardice,
whether we will or no; we are in their Power:
This unreasonable Passion may bring great Mischief
to us; perhaps it may occasion us to be brought back to
<span class="antiqua">Constantinople</span>, and there our whole Negotiation may
be reversed, or at least become very dubious. I beseech
thee, therefore, for my Sake among the rest, govern
thy Passion.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> <i>Henry</i> was deaf to all his Persuasions; he
being an obstinate Fellow, and when angry, would
not hearken to Reason. <i>What care I</i>, replied he,
<i>if I had killed him? Did he not design to kill me?
If one of his many Blows had gone home, he had
knock’d me down like an Ox. Were I to be blamed,
if I slew him who would have slain me first? I am
sorry with all my Heart, I did not give him his
Death’s Wound: But, for the future (take my
Word for it) I’ll spare never a <span class="antiqua">Turk</span> of them all;
for, if he assaults me, I’ll give him as good as he
brings, though it cost me my Life.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>De Sande</i></span> did not like this surly Answer; but
the <i>Janizary</i> who had received the Wound, made
the worst of it; upon whose Complaint, two Jews,
who could speak <i>Spanish</i>, came to me, and told me,
that he was dangerously hurt, and if he did not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
give him Satisfaction, the Matter would not so soon
be passed over, but would create great Trouble to
me. I answered them as I thought fit; but, because
I knew the malicious Natures of the <i>Turks</i>, I
thought it best speedily to guard against them; and,
therefore, sent presently one of the Youths to <i>Ebrahim</i>,
desiring him to let one of his Servants be
a Guide to one of mine to <i>Constantinople</i>, a sudden
Emergency had made this Journey necessary. <i>Ebrahim</i>
wondered what the Matter was, and came presently
to me to know. I told him, I desired a
better Convoy from <i>Hali Bassa</i>, otherwise I was
out of Hopes ever to reach Home, for my two
Servants were like to be killed; and then I told
him the whole Story, with all its Circumstances.
<i>Ebrahim</i> soon perceived how much his own Interest
was concerned, and therefore desired me to have
a little Patience till he had spoken with the <i>Janizary</i>;
to whom he presently went, and found him
in Bed. He chid him very warmly for being so
abusive to us, and told him I had made Peace with
the <i>Port</i>, and was in great Favour with <i>Solyman</i>,
and all the <i>Bashaws</i>; that they had denied none
of my Requests, but had granted me several Concessions
for my own Sake, and that he was sent
back to convoy me safe into my own Country,
and to take Care that I might be honourably treated
by the Way: That he was the first Man that
offered me the least Affront; and that I was sending
back one to <i>Constantinople</i> to complain thereof;
and if I did, it might cost him his Head. This
took down my <i>Janizary</i>’s Crest, and put him into
a terrible Panick besides.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next Day we continued our Journey to
<i>Buda</i>; and the Physician, notwithstanding his
Bruises, was as well able to travel as any of us.
When we came in Sight of <i>Buda</i>, the <i>Bashaw</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
thereof sent some of his own Family, with several
<i>Chiauxes</i> to meet us; and among the rest, there
was a Troop of young Men on Horseback, which
drew our Eyes after them in respect of the Novelty
of their Garb; their Heads were uncovered, and
their Crowns shav’d; there was a long Line cut
with a Knife, and in the Wound they stuck Feathers
of several Sorts; and, though Drops of Blood distilled
down from their Wounds, yet they dissembled
their Pain, and rode merrily on, as if they ailed nothing
at all. Just before me, there walked some
Footmen; one of them had his naked Arms a-kembow,
and both had a Knife, (such as we call
<i>Pragensian</i>) run through them above the Elbow;
another was naked, all the upper Parts, to his Navel,
the Skin of his Loyns being so cut in two
Places, both above and below, that a Club being
run through them, hung down from thence as from
a Girdle; another had a Horshoe nail’d to the
Crown of his Head, and it was so old, that the
Shoe and the Skin grew together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this Pomp we entered <i>Buda</i>, and were introduced
to the <i>Bashaw</i>, with whom, in the Presence
of <i>de Sande</i>, I had a long Discourse concerning the
Validity of the Truce I had made. In the Passage
to him there stood those hardy Youngsters who were
regardless of their Pain; casting my Eye upon
them, the <i>Bashaw</i> demanded, what I thought of
them? I think, said I, that they are hardy Fellows;
only they do that to their Skins, which I would
not do to my Cloaths, for I had rather have them
whole than slash’d. Whereupon, the <i>Bashaw</i> laughed,
and dismissed us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Day after we came to <i>Gran</i>; from thence
to <i>Comara</i>, the Frontier Garrison of the Empire,
situate on the River <i>Wage</i>; on both sides its Banks
the Garrison of the Place, with the Seamen, called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
their <i>Nassadists</i>, waited for us. Before I passed over
the River, <i>de Sande</i> came to me, and embracing me
in his Arms, gave me Thanks for completing his
Liberty: He told me plainly, he thought the <i>Turks</i>
had but dissembled with him, and therefore, he
was in continual Fear, lest he should be haled
back to <i>Constantinople</i> to die in Prison; but now,
being in the Emperor’s Territories, he acknowleged
himself to be eternally obliged to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A</span> few Days more brought us to <i>Vienna</i>. <i>Ferdinand</i>
the Emperor, was then at the Imperial Diet,
with his Son <i>Maximilian</i>, about Inaugurating him
<i>King of the Romans</i>. I acquainted <i>Cæsar</i> with my
Return, and with <i>Ebrahim</i>’s coming, and desired to
receive his Commands concerning him; for he had
a great Desire to wait upon the Emperor at <i>Francfort</i>.
His Highness’s first Answer was, That ’twere
best for the <i>Turks</i> to stay at <i>Vienna</i> till his Return, it
being not adviseable to carry an Enemy thro’ the very
Heart of the Country, so long a Way as from <i>Vienna</i>
to <i>Francfort</i>. And, on the other side, Delays were
dangerous, and might create Suspicion in the <i>Turks</i>
of some unfair Dealing. As for <i>Ebrahim</i>, and his
Retinue, there was no danger in suffering them to
pass through the most flourishing Part of the Empire;
it was, indeed, desirable rather, that thereby
they might take an Estimate of the Strength and
Greatness of it, especially having now so fair an
Opportunity of observing at <i>Francfort</i>, with how
great Unanimity Prince <i>Maximilian</i> was chosen and
designed Successor to the Emperor his Father. When
I wrote back to the Emperor according to the Purport
aforesaid, he consented that <i>Ebrahim</i> and his
Retinue should come to <i>Francfort</i>. We began our
Journey thither by the Way of <i>Prague</i>, <i>Bamberg</i>,
and <i>Wirtzburg</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Ebrahim</i></span> passing through <i>Bohemia</i>, was willing
to pay his Court to Arch-Duke <i>Ferdinand</i>; but
the Arch-Duke would have it <i>incognito</i>. When we
were a few Days Journey from <i>Francfort</i>, I thought
proper to ride a Day or two’s Journey before, to acquaint
the Emperor with some Things relating to
my Embassy; which I did, and came to <i>Francfort</i>
that Day seven Years on which I set out from <i>Vienna</i>
to <i>Constantinople</i>. I was received by my
Master with all imaginable Kindness, (not that I deserv’d
it) but ’twas all owing to his innate Goodness
and Custom so to do. You may imagine with
yourself how joyful a Thing it was to me, after
so many Years Absence, to return safe to the Presence
of my Royal Master, who was pleased kindly
to accept of the Fruits of my Embassy, and told
me, that I had done all Things well, and that I
should find the Effects of his Favour. He came to
<i>Francfort</i> the Day before the Inauguration, late in
the Evening, when the Gates were shut; and all
the following Day they were not to be opened, by
ancient Custom: But his Imperial Majesty gave express
Command that they should be opened for
the <i>Turks</i>. They had a Place assigned them, from
whence they might behold <i>Cæsar</i> Elect pass by
with great Pomp and Splendor; it appear’d to them
a glorious and magnificent Sight to see, amongst
others of <i>Cæsar</i>’s honourable Train, three Princes,
who could raise great Armies in their own Territories;
to wit, the Dukes of <i>Saxony</i>, <i>Bavaria</i> and
<i>Brandenburg</i>: They saw also, many other Monuments
of the Dignity and Greatness of the Emperor.
A few Days after, <i>Ebrahim</i> was introduced into his
Presence, and delivered the noble Presents the <i>Sultan</i>
had sent him. The Emperor confirm’d the
Peace, rewarded him amply, and sent him back
with large Presents to <i>Solyman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> am very willing to leave the Court, as not being
pleased with that kind of Life; but some private
Affairs as yet detain me. I know the Tediousness
of Court-Attendance; much Mischief lies
under an Appearance of Splendor; much Disguise,
but little of Sincerity is there; all Courts are subject
to Envy; faithful Friendship is hard to be found,
and a change of Mind may occasion a Man’s sudden
Ruin: For Princes themselves are but Men. I
have seen a Man come to Court with a thousand
Attendants, whom his Prince’s Displeasure has sent
away with scarce one in his Company. A Court
does not know what is truly good, till too late; it
is altogether led by Shews, Shadows, Fallacies, and
popular Mistakes. Those are fortunate Men who
can lead such a Life in safety; but oh! may I live
to the Muses and to my self, and grow old in a
Country-Cottage, with a few trusty Friends! If any
Life be desirable in this earthly Pilgrimage, ’tis this.
Look upon the Court, and you will find there a
Noble Buffoon preferred before a good Man: So
that if you would represent a good Man amongst
Courtiers, you may paint an Ass amongst Apes. I
speak of common Courts in general; for I know that
our Court, as well as some others, are adorn’d with
many excellent and noble Personages: However,
Solitude and Quiet affording Vacation to Study, is
preferr’d by me before the Crowd and Noise of Courts.
But, I am afraid, my best of Princes will not
vouchsafe me the Retreat I beg for. ’Tis true, he
gave me leave to depart, but upon this Condition,
that I should return when call’d upon. If he commands
me to Court again (for who can withstand
the Desire of so gracious a Prince?) this only Comfort
will be left me, that I shall every Day behold
the Face of the most sacred of all Emperors; or (to
phrase it otherwise) shall contemplate the living<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
Image of true Vertue: For assure yourself, that the
Sun never shone upon a better Prince than this, nor
one who governs more justly. Though his true,
that the Majesty of Empire is a glorious Thing, yet
to desire Empire, and to carry ones self worthy of
it, is more Glorious. I speak not of his Birth, nor
of the Nobleness of his Ancestors, he needs not such
far-fetch’d Helps; his own Vertue is sufficient.
Many Emperors have been (though unworthy)
raised to the Throne; but his own Vertue exalted
him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Again</span>, some have managed the Beginning of
their Reign innocently and justly, but soon after
they have degenerated into Licentiousness and Corruption,
<i>Forgetting they are Men, they would be
esteem’d as Gods, and ador’d as such, endeavouring to
be placed among the Gods; whereas they were unworthy
to be reckon’d among Men</i>. All men’s Necks
cannot bear the Burthen of a high Estate, to which
if they are advanced, they forget themselves: ’Tis
a hard Thing to be able to compass all that a Man
desires; and yet ’tis as hard to desire nothing but
that which is good.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> for our Prince, his Eyes are not dazzled by
Greatness; no Man retains Vertue more steadily
he, nor takes greater heed that his pure Mind be
not defiled by the Taint of his Fortune. He was
always of this Opinion, That, as Majestic Robes
attract the Eyes of Spectators, the Sanctity of Manners
should much more incline their Minds. Therefore,
he chiefly studies Piety, worships and adores
his God, and lives always as in his Sight and Presence;
he squares all his Actions throughout the
whole Course of his Life by a Divine Rule and
Prescript: Whatever happens either Prosperous or
Adverse, he looks upon God as the Author, and
receives it gratefully, as proceeding from his Hand.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
Thus he lives an Heavenly Life even upon Earth;
he is not ignorant whole image he bears; and therefore,
all his Words and Deeds are directed for the
Public Good, for which he thinks he was born, and
therefore prefers it before Advantages; He is so intent
herein, that some blame him for being overmuch
addicted to the Common-wealth, and neglecting
his own Children and Family. He is extremely
Courteous to all his Subjects, as if they were
under his particular Care, and Himself were the Father
of so vast a Family. What poor Man hath
ever desired his help in vain? Who is there that hath
not experienced his Liberality? He thinks that Day
lost wherein he hath not done Good to somebody.
He is beneficient to all, and in a singular Manner
kind to his Domesticks; not a Man of them can say,
that ever he was neglected by them. He knows their
way of Life, the Deserts, yea, and the very Names
even of the meanest of them. Tho’ he is so great a
Prince, yet he thinks it not below himself, at convenient
Opportunities to warn the negligent, and put
them in mind of their Duty; and, if they mend their
Manners, to reward them accordingly: So that they
depart from him, rather as from a Father than a Master.
He administers Justice with great Equity; for
he thinks it unreasonable to prescribe Law’s to others,
and break them himself; or to punish them in others,
which he allows in himself. He never speaks rudely
of any Man, and always honourably of the Absent.
Probity is safe under his Guardianship; but
Malice, Force, Fraud, evil and corrupt Ministers
are exterminated, Offences and Wickednesses duly
punish’d. The old <i>Romans</i> had Censors of Manners
imposed upon them, to keep the People to their
Duty; but here there is no need of any Censor,
the Life of the Prince is a sufficient Censor, he is
a shining Example to all, in what they should<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
avoid, and what they should pursue. Good and
learned Men which may profit the Commonwealth,
he highly esteems; with these he is conversant,
and, laying aside his Majesty, treats them
as Friends and Equals; yea, he emulates their
Virtues without Respect, whether they are Paternal
and Hereditary, or acquired by their own Industry.
With these, he spends the little Time he can spare
from public Business: These are the Persons highly
esteem’d by him, as judging it a public Benefit to
restore due Honour to Vertue. He himself being
curious by Nature, and desirous to know something
worthy of a Man, has always some Questions
to propose to the Learned; and sometimes he brings
in some smart and genteel Repartees of his own, to
the Admiration of his Hearers. Thus he hath
laid in so considerable a Stock of Learning, that you
cannot question him in any Thing, but he can
give you some Account of it. He understands
many Languages; first, the <i>Spanish</i>, which is his
<i>Mother-Tongue</i>; next the <i>French</i>, <i>German</i>, <i>Latin</i>,
and <i>Italian</i>: He can express his Meaning pretty
well in the <i>Latin</i>, yet not so exactly, but that sometimes
he breaks <i>Priscian</i>’s Head; a Fault blameworthy
in a <i>Gramarian</i>, but excusable in an <i>Emperor</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> I have said of him, all Men living know
to be true; but, perhaps, some may think it a Defect,
that he is not enough given to Arms, and Atchievements
worthy of the Laurel: For, say they,
the <i>Turks</i> carry all in <i>Hungary</i>, and we do not
help nor relieve them, as we ought; we should
have join’d Armies in the Field, that it might be
known whom Providence would have to bear Rule.
I confess this Objection savours of Bravery, more
than of Prudence, and therefore, let me trace the
Matter a little higher. I am of his Opinion, That<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
the <i>Genius</i> of Emperors are to be judged of rather
by their Councils, than by their Fortunes or Events;
and that, by those Councils, the Times, our own
Strength, the Nature and Power of our Enemies
are to be regulated. If a common Enemy, well
known to us, and famous for no Victory, should
invade our Borders, ’twere Cowardice not to oppose
him, if we have Forces enough. But if the Enemy
be such as seem to be sent as a Scourge from
God (such was <i>Atila</i> of old, <i>Tamerlane</i> in the Days
of our Forefathers, and the <i>Ottoman Princes</i> in our
Age) whom nothing can withstand, who lays all
waste before him; to oppose such an Enemy with
small and new-levied Forces, would not only be
rash, but even Madness itself. <i>Solyman</i> comes terrible,
by his own and his Ancestor’s Successes: He
invades <i>Hungary</i> with 200,000 Horse, he draws
near to <i>Austria</i>, and threatens the rest of <i>Germany</i>;
his Troops are fetched from the very Confines of
<i>Persia</i>; his Army is furnished from many Nations;
each of the Three known Parts of the World conspire
therein for our Destruction: He, like Lightning,
strikes down all before him with his battering Army,
and fills all Places with the Terror of his Name;
he roars and Hovers round our Borders, striving to
break in sometimes here, sometimes there. Many
Nations of old, when they have been threatned
with such Potent Enemies, have left their Native
Country, and sought out other Habitations. To
be unmoved in small Dangers, is but a mean kind
of Praise; but not to be terrify’d by the coming of
so great an Enemy, who has laid waste so many
bordering Kingdoms, seems to me an <i>Herculean</i>
kind of Constancy. Amidst these Dangers, <i>Ferdinand</i>
heroically keeps his Station, and being of an
unconquered Spirit, will not quit that, or his State.
He could wish his Forces were sufficient to put all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
to the Hazard of a Battel, and that nothing of
Madness were imputable to him upon that Account;
but Prudence restrains his generous Efforts: He sees
with what great Hazard his faithful Subjects, and
the Ruin of all Christendom, <i>an unsuccessful Battel
would prove</i>, and is very unwilling that the Public
should pay for his Rashness. He considers how
great the Odds would be, between 25 or 30,000
Foot, with a small Number of Horse, and 200,000
Horse, supported by a Veteran Body of Foot.
What Hopes there may be of Success in that Case,
the Example of former Times, and the Blood-shed
at <i>Nicopolis</i>, and at <i>Varna</i>, and the Fields of <i>Mohac</i>,
as yet white with the Bones of <i>Christians</i>
slain there, sufficiently inform us. ’Tis the Part
of a foolish Commander, without duly weighing
his own and the Enemy’s Strength, to rush into
Battel, where his Loss can find no wiser an Excuse
than, <i>I had not thought</i>. ’Tis all in all, what the
Enemy is with whom we are to cope; this is an
infallible Rule, laid down by all the gravest Authors
that ever wrote of Military Affairs: such was <i>Cæsar</i>;
he counted it a Happiness to <i>Lucullus</i> and to <i>Pompey</i>,
that they had to do with a slothful Enemy, over
whom they got Victories without Dust or Sweat;
and when he had obtained such an easy Victory
over <i>Pharnaces</i>, he jestingly said, <i>I came, I saw,
I overcame</i>: But were to make War with the
People of those Countries (then effeminated by
Luxury, but now harden’d by Want, Frugality,
Hunger, Cold, Heat, continual Fatigue, and Severity
of Discipline, to do and suffer any thing) he
would tell us another Story. Hence it is, that
<i>Livy</i> reasons upon good Grounds, that <i>Alexander</i>
the <i>Macedonian</i> would not have had the same Success
against the <i>Roman Enemy</i>, as against the <i>Persian</i>,
or the Womanish <i>Indian</i>: There is a good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
deal of Difference between a Warlike, and a Luxurious
People, unaccustomed to Arms. ’Tis true,
the Multitude of <i>Persians</i> made it an Admiration,
<i>That there was more Toil in Killing, than in Overcoming
them</i>. In my Judgment, <i>Hannibal</i>’s three
Victories at <i>Trebia</i>, at <i>Thrasymene</i>, and at <i>Cannæ</i>,
did far exceed all the Exploits of <i>Alexander</i>: For
why? the one overcame valiant Warriors, the other
had to do with the slothful People of <i>Asia</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><i>Fabius Maximus</i></span> had as much Courage, as
<i>Titus Sempronius</i>, <i>Caius Flaminius</i>, or <i>Varro</i>; and
more Judgment: That great Commander knew
that he had to do with an Enemy educated in the
Camp, well vers’d in Arms, skilful in Military
Discipline, who by a singular Fate, or Felicity,
had obtained many Victories; therefore he was
not rashly to venture all, but to use Delay to
weary him out; that was the only Hope left against
so great an Enemy, to evade his Assaults, and to
drill on the Combat till an Opportunity was afforded
for a Remedy. In the mean time, he was to be
watch’d, restrain’d, and, as it were, nibbled at;
wherein he was so happy, that <i>Fabius</i> was as
much Renown’d as <i>Scipio</i> himself, who ended the
War against <i>Hannibal</i>; for who knows whether
<i>Scipio</i> would have ever overcome him, if <i>Fabius</i>
had not first stopped the Course of his Victories?
To overcome by Prudence is as highly to be priz’d,
as to overcome by Force. The former has nothing
common with Beasts, but Force has.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i> had the same Design
with <i>Fabius Maximus</i>, if his and <i>Solyman</i>’s Forces
had been equal. His first Work would have been, to
put all to the hazard of a Battel; but the Inequality
considered, his next Design was, to stop an
over-flowing Flood in Walls and Banks; and herein
he employ’d his utmost Endeavours. ’Tis about<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
Forty Years since <i>Solyman</i>, in the Beginning of his
Reign, took <i>Belgrade</i>, slew <i>Lewis</i> King of <i>Hungary</i>,
and thereby promised himself the Possession of
that and other Countries; in hopes whereof he besieged
<i>Vienna</i>, and, renewing the War, he reduced
<i>Gonitzium</i> again, threaten’d <i>Vienna</i> at a Distance.
But what did he get by this great Armament: He
was forced to stick in that Part of <i>Hungary</i> which
he had already taken. He that was wont to conquer
great Kingdoms by one Expedition, now subdued
only some weak Castles and small Towns,
which cost him dear: ’Tis true, he saw <i>Vienna</i>
once, but never after. ’Tis said, that <i>Solyman</i> wished
his Life to be prolonged, to see three Things finished,
<i>viz.</i> The Structure of his Temple, a sumptuous
and magnificent Work! the repairing of the
old Aquæducts to bring Water enough into <i>Constantinople</i>,
and the Conquest of <i>Vienna</i>. The two
first he hath accomplished; but at the third he sticks,
and I hope ever will; so that he always calls <i>Vienna</i>
his <i>Ignominy</i> and <i>Disgrace</i>. But to return.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Emperor <i>Ferdinand</i> may, doubtless, be
register’d among the most famous Generals; for,
though he had far less Aid than the Danger required,
he yet was Master of himself, and principally
by his Courage, he hath endured the Efforts of
a powerful Enemy, for so many Years together:
So that a greater Praise is due to him for preserving
a great Part of <i>Hungary</i> for better Times, than
to many Warriors, who with multitude of Military
Preparations, and favourable Opportunities, have
got many Victories over Kings and their Armies.
The less Assistance he has had in a necessary Time,
by so much the more the Valour of his Mind hath
eminently appeared. Whosoever doth not put all
upon one Event in the height of Success, not considering
the Power of the Enemy, and the Seasonableness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
of assaulting him, must needs conclude,
<i>That ’tis next to a <span class="antiqua">PRODIGY</span>, that the
open and extensive Kingdom of <span class="antiqua">Hungary</span>, distracted
with long Discords, could be defended so long, and
that all of it is not already brought under the Yoke of
so powerful an Enemy. ’Tis God’s great Mercy, and
our Prince’s infinite Care that hath prevented it;
whilst he is combating with one Difficulty, another
arises in view greater than the former. The Enemy
is in sight, Friends afar off, the Auxiliary Forces of
his Brother <span class="antiqua">Charles</span> too at a great Distance; <span class="antiqua">Germany</span>,
though next to the Fire, yet weary in sending
Aid; the Hereditary Countries exhausted by Contribution,
and the Ears of many <span class="antiqua">Christian</span> Princes deaf
when Assistance is desired of them, rather doing any
thing, than that which is incumbent upon them; so
that he is forced to withstand the Enemy only by his
own Arms, with the Assistance of some <span class="antiqua">Hungarians</span>,
<span class="antiqua">Austrians</span>, and <span class="antiqua">Bohemians</span>, and sometimes by hiring
some <span class="antiqua">Italian</span> or <span class="antiqua">Spanish</span> Soldiers at a vast Expence. He
defends the Confines of <span class="antiqua">Hungary</span>, with Garrisons
fifteen Days Journey long; and has always Soldiers
in Pay, even in Time of Truce. A Truce is sometimes
necessary, and when the coming of a Tyrant is
fear’d, and the Time affords no Opportunity of Resistance,
’tis seasonable to send Embassies to pacify him,
that so great a Calamity may be averted from miserable
<span class="antiqua">Hungary</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Whilst</span> our <i>Prince</i> has such a Burthen upon
his Mind, he can hardly sleep for a whole Night together;
he watches for the good of the Commonwealth;
so great a Concern requires a perpetual
Vigilance and constant Care. Do not think I
flatter him: what I write is true. He hath but few
Assistants in his Government, but those are very
good Men; the chief of whom, not unknown to
you by Name, are, <i>Johannes Trantzen</i>, <i>Rudolphus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
a Harrach</i>, both eminent for their Faithfulness and
Prudence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> shall detain you no longer than to give you
some Account of our Prince’s private Deportment.
He rises every Day at Five o’Clock in the Morning,
even in the coldest Winter Months; and first,
he performs his Devotion to God, then he goes to
the Council to consult of Matters tending to the
Public Good, ’till Dinner-time; he follows the
same Course in the Afternoon, till Supper-time;
I mean the Time of his Counsellors Supper, not
his own: he never sups, he eats but once a Day,
and that sparingly too; and is as abstemious in
Drinking; he closes his Dinner with a double Glass
of Wine: He passes the Night chastly, ever since
the Loss of his Royal Consort: He cannot endure
the trifling Amusements which many are taken
with, and will have nothing to do with Jesters,
Jugglers, Buffoons, Parasites, the common Delights,
and yet Plagues, of Courts. He hates Idleness, is a
very great Husband of his Time; if he has any to
spare from public Business, which but rarely happens,
he spends it in Conferences with good and learned
Men, who (as I told you before) are his chief Delight,
and usual Attendants whilst he is at Dinner.
I believe that several of the Commons would not
change their Life for his, ’tis so thrifty and severe:
What Man is there that does not set apart some
small Portion of his Time to indulge himself? Who
would willingly deprive himself of all Delights? To
whom would it not seem irksom to grow old in
perpetual Care and Business. This looks more like
Servitude than Sovereignty: But our Prince is of
another Mind; neither doth he dissemble it in his
ordinary Discourse: He says, he was advanced to
so great an Office by God, not for his own Sake;
that the Reins of Government were not put into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
his Hands, to wallow in Pleasures and Delights:
The case of Succession in Kingdoms and Empires
differs from the Condition of private Inheritances;
in these latter, no Man is denied to indulge himself
in the Conveniencies of his Patrimony. But so
many Nations are intrusted to him by God, that he
might have the Care and Labour, and they the Benefit
of his Care, so as to obtain Rest and Quiet by
his Sweat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> Hunting only he spends a little Time, not so
much for Pleasure, as for Health; for when he finds
his Body fall away, and his Spirits flag by continual
sitting for many Days together, he chooses one Day
to refresh himself with the freer Air in the open
Field; and in Summer very early in the Morning,
and in Winter some Hours before Sun-rising, what
Weather soever it be, he goes Abroad to Hunting,
and sometimes he does so in the Afternoon; for I
remember when I attended him at Dinner, I heard
him say, <i>I have done my Duty this Day; I have
dispatched all Business that are on the File; I may
now spend the rest of the Day for the Health of my
Body</i>. Thus he returns late at Night from the
Death of a Boar, Stag, or Bear, and betakes his
wearied Limbs to rest, without Eating or Drinking.
Let no Man then upbraid us with the want of
<i>Trajans</i>, <i>Varus</i>’s, and <i>Theodosius</i>’s; those Miracles
of the Ancients in our Days: I dare take my Oath,
that there is more true Vertue in our Emperor, than
there was in all of them put together. But the Admiration
of so great a Man transports me: ’Tis
not my Design to speak of his Merits, they would
make up a Volume rather than an Epistle; besides,
they require an Ingenuity far exceeding mine; and,
therefore, my Aim was only to give you some
Hints, <i>That you may know what a Master I serv’d</i>.
I close all with this public Prayer, <i>That he may return<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
late to Heaven, whose vertuous and holy Presence
alleviates the Miseries of our Age</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> to the <i>Greek Books</i> which you enquire after,
and the Rarities, and the wild Beasts of a strange
Kind, which you hear I have brought back, they
are hardly worth mentioning: Among them, there
is one <i>Ichneumon</i> very gentle, which is known for
its deadly Quarrels with the <i>Crocodile</i> and the <i>Asp</i>.
I had also a <i>Weesel</i> of that kind they call an <i>Ermine</i>,
very beautiful; but I lost it on the Way. I have
many brave Horses, such as no Man ever brought
from thence before, and six She-Camels. I brought
back no Shrubs nor Herbs, but in Painting, which
I left to the Care of <i>Matthiolus</i>, with some other
Things, many Years ago. I sent him Tapestry
and Linnen after the <i>Babylonian</i> Fashion, with
Swords, Bows, and other Trappings: I have also
many other Things made of Horses-hides, curiously
wrought after the <i>Turkish</i> Fashion, or rather I may
say, I had them; for in so great an Assembly of
principal Men and Women at <i>Francfort</i>, one beg’d
one Thing, and another another; so that I have but
a small Matter left. The rest of my Gifts was well
bestowed; but I am very sorry that I was lavish of
one Balsam, because Physicians call the Truth of it
in question, as not answering all the Marks that
<i>Pliny</i> gives of it: Whether it be that the Virtue of
those ancient Plants from whence it flows, be weakned
by Age, or from any other Cause; this I know
for certain, that it trickles down from Shrubs in the
<i>Mattarcan Gardens</i> near <i>Cairo</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I left <i>Constantinople</i>, I sent one <i>Albacarus</i>,
a <i>Spanish Physician</i>, into <i>Lemnos</i>, on the sixth
Day of <i>August</i>, to be present at the digging out
that famous Earth, desiring him to write me the
Certainty of its Place, Origin, manner of Extracting
and Use; which I know he will do, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
he is not hindered. I had a Mind to go thither my
self to be an Eye-witness of it; but, the <i>Turks</i> not
giving me leave, I deputed him in my Stead. I have
brought back also abundance of old Coins, the chief
of which I shall present my Master with. Besides,
I have whole Waggon-loads, if not Ship-loads, of
<i>Greek Manuscripts</i>, and about 240 Books, which I
sent by Sea to <i>Venice</i>, from thence to be carried to
<i>Vienna</i>: I design them for <i>Cæsar</i>’s Library; there
are many of them common, but some choice; I
rummaged every Corner to procure such Kind of
Merchandize, as my last gleaning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I</span> left one very old Manuscript behind me at <i>Constantinople</i>,
all very well written in large Characters;
it was <i>Diascorides</i>, with the Figures of Plants,
wherein there were some few Things of <i>Crativa</i>,
and the Book of Birds; ’tis in the Possession of a
<i>Jew</i>, the Son of <i>Hammon</i>, who in his Life-time
was <i>Solyman</i>’s Physician: I desir’d to buy it, but
the Price frightned me; he rated it at 100 Ducats,
a Price fit for <i>Cæsar</i>’s Purse, not mine. However,
I will not cease to press <i>Cæsar</i> to redeem so famous
an Author from that Bondage: ’tis very much injur’d
by Time, and so eaten with Worms on the
out-side, that a Man would hardly take it up, if
it lay in the Streets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> to conclude, you may expect me in a very
short Time. I shall reserve what remains, till we
meet: In the mean Time, do you take Care to
provide some good and learned Men, by whose
Conversation I may drive away the dull Thoughts
remaining in my Mind, from my long Aboad among
the <i>Turks</i>. Farewell!</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
